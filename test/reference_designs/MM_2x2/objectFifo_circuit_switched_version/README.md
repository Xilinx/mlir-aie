## MM_2x2 Design Example : (Object FIFO) Circuit-Switch Version

### Overall Description<br>
This is an end-to-end matrix multiply example with sizes (32 * 64) * (64 * 64) which uses the AXI stream switch in circuit mode to transfer data.<br>
This design uses 4 AIEs for computation and 3 Shim tiles for data movement to and from external memory. <br>

This particular design leverages the object FIFO abstraction, which lowers into the circuit-switched version. With this abstraction, AIE buffers and locks are abstracted into the object FIFO and can only be interacted with via acquire, release and subview access operations. <br>
Another advantage of using this abstraction is that there is no need to explicitly setup data movement primitives such as AIE tiles or Shim DMAs or flows. These are all automatically generated by the lowering based on the position of the AIE tiles. <br>

### Computation Kernel<br>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &nbsp; LHS &emsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RHS &emsp; &emsp; Acc &emsp; &emsp; Output<br>
Each of the 4 AIEs computes (32 * 32) * (32 * 32) + (32 * 32) = (32 * 32). In the single kernel design(kernel.cc) left-hand-side(LHS), right-hand-side(RHS), accumulator(Acc) and output matrix are all column based.<br>

### Mapping Strategy<br>
The following figure shows the mapping strategy of this design in which LHS and Output each have two (32 * 32) tiles, RHS has four (32 * 32) tiles.<br>

### AIE array Layout and Data Communication<br>
1. The communication from tile (6,0) MM2S0 channel is a broadcast in which tile0 of LHS is broadcast to tile(6,3) and tile (7,3). The data in tile1 of LHS is broadcast to tile (6,4) and tile (7,4)  via channel MM2S1. As the channels are not time-multiplexed, 4 more output channels, i.e., 2 Shim DMAs (7, 0) and (10, 0), are required to communicate the RHS tiles to the 4 AIEs. <br> 
2. One thing to notice is that the accumulator matrices are set to zero in the local memories of the AIEs on tile (6,3) and tile (7,3). <br>
3. The accumulator matrices resulting from computation on tiles (6, 3) and (7, 3) are respectively communicated to tiles (6, 4) and (7, 4) via shared memory. <br>
