These tests are not supported currently for a few reasons:
* They use outdated syntax for the runtime sequence and it would take effort to port
* They use deprecated/removed `aie.compiler.aiecc.util` functionality, and these functions are not available any more.

However, these test cases may be interesting in the future and worth testing, so we leave them here currently.
