# <ins>Distribute Repeat</ins>

This reference design can be run on a Ryzenâ„¢ AI NPU.

In the [design](./aie2.py) data is brought from external memory via the `ShimTile` to the `MemTile`. The data is then split between two `ComputeTile`s using a distribute operation specified via an `object_fifo_link`. Each input objectfifo between the `MemTile` and each `ComputeTile` is further configured to repeat the data so as to send multiple copies of that data to each `ComputeTile`.

For more information, the `object_fifo_link` operation as well as the concept of distribution and its functionality is described in more depth in [Section-2b](../../../../programming_guide/section-2/section-2b/03_Link_Distribute_Join/README.md#object-fifo-link) of the programming guide.
