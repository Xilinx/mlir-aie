Horizontal diffusion (hdiff) is a process used in numerical weather prediction models to help smooth out small-scale variations in the atmosphere and reduce the impact of numerical errors. It is a mathematical technique used to represent the turbulent mixing of the atmosphere, which occurs due to the winds and temperature gradients in the atmosphere. hdiff is used in a variety of other local and global weather prediction models. hdiff is a fundamental kernel found in the dynamical core of the COSMO and other regional and global climate and weather prediction models, including the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model and the Global Forecast System (GFS) model. It is also used in climate models, such as the Community Earth System Model (CESM)  and the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC).
