### `-convert-aie-to-control-packets`

_Convert AIE dialect to npu control packet operations_

This pass converts aie.device operations to a sequence of control packet
operations (`npu.control_packet`) that can be used to configure the npu
device. A new `aiex.runtime_sequence` operation is inserted into the
`aie.device` to contain the new control packet sequence.

#### Options

```
-elf-dir : Where to find ELF files
```

### `-convert-aie-to-transaction`

_Convert AIE dialect to npu transaction operations_

This pass converts aie.device operations to a sequence of transaction binary
operations (writes, masked writes, and block writes) that can be used to
configure the npu device. The transaction operations are emitted as
`npu.write32`, `npu.maskwrite32`, and `npu.blockwrite` operations. A new
`aiex.runtime_sequence` operation is inserted into the `aie.device` to
contain the new transaction operations sequence.

#### Options

```
-elf-dir : Where to find ELF files
```

### `-convert-aievec-to-llvm`

_Convert AIEVec dialect to LLVM dialect_

This pass converts AIEVec dialect ops to LLVM dialect calls to builtins.

#### Options

```
-aie2-fp32-emulation-strategy : Set the AIE2 FP32 emulation strategy. Elementwise multiplication and matrix multiplication intrinsics for FP32 input type are emulated using bfloat16 data-path.
```
