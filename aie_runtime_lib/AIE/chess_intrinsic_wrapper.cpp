/// This file contains symbols that are used in Chess compilation to implement
/// intrinsics.  It tries to solve the problem that the Chess compiler does not
/// implement 'standard' llvm intrinsics (which contain '.') as a separator.
/// Rather than implement a fragile mechanism that relies on a particular
/// encoding this file is compiled with the Chess compiler to generate the
/// proper encoding and then this file is linked with code generated with
/// llvm-style intrinsics. Note that the Chess frontend replaces '.' with '___'
/// when parsing .ll code containing standard intrinsic names, so these symbols
/// are defined that way.
