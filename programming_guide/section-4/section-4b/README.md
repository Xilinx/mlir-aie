-----

In the previous [section-4a](../section-4a), we looked at how timers can be used to get an overview of application performance. However, for kernel programmers that want to optimize the AIE hardware to its fullest potential, being able to see how efficiently the AIE cores and data movers are running is important. As such, the AIEs are equipped with tracing hardware that provides a cycle accurate view of hardware events. More detailed specification of the AIE2 trace unit can be found at in [AM020](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/am020-versal-aie-ml/Trace).

Enabling trace support can be done with the following steps:

## <u>Steps to Enable Trace Support</u>
1. [Enable and configure AIE trace units](#1-enable-and-configure-aie-trace-units)
1. [Configure host code to read trace data and write it to a text file](#2-configure-host-code-to-read-trace-data-and-write-it-to-a-text-file)
1. [Parse text file to generate a waveform json file](#3-parse-text-file-to-generate-a-waveform-json-file)
1. [Open json file in a visualization tool like Perfetto](#4-open-json-file-in-a-visualization-tool-like-perfetto)
* [Additional Debug Hints](#additional-debug-hints)


## <u>1. Enable and configure AIE trace units</u>

Enabling tracing means (1a) configuring the trace units for a given tile and then (1b) routing the generated events packets through the stream switches to the shim DMA where we can write them to a buffer in DDR for post-runtime processing.

### <u>(1a) Configure trace units for an AIE tile</u>
The first necessary component for trace configuration is setting the right values for the trace control registers for each tile that we want to enable tracing for. In addition, the generated trace packets will need to be routed to a shimDMA and then written to an inout buffers so the packet data can be written to DDR. We have abstracted these two steps with the python wrapper function `configure_packet_tracing_aie2` which is in [python/utils/test.py](../../../python/utils/test.py) and is described in more detail in the [README](../../../python/utils) under `python/utils`. An example of how this function is used is shown below for quick reference:
```python
    trace_utils.configure_packet_tracing_aie2(tiles_to_trace, ShimTile, opts.trace_size)
```
The arguments for this example are:
* *tiles_to_trace* - array of tiles we want to trace (including mem tiles and shim tiles)
* *ShimTile* - shim tile that the trace is routed to for writing to DDR
* *opts.trace_size* - the trace buffer size in bytes

This block is defined within the sequence definition for `@runtime_sequence` where we define the shimDMA data movement to the inout buffers.
> **Note** This convenience python wrapper abtracts a number of sub-steps for configuring the trace unit in each tile and the shimDMA for writing to DDR. This uses packet switched routing to move the trace packets as opposed to circuit switched routing. More details on these sub-steps can be found in the [README](../../../python/utils) under `python/utils`.

Configuring the trace units with `configure_packet_tracing_aie2` should be declared at the beginning of the `@runtime_sequence` so the trace mechanisms are in place prior to any data being transferred from/ to DDR. At the end of the `@runtime_sequence` we add the following convenience python function to end the trace collection.
```python
    trace_utils.gen_trace_done_aie2(ShimTile)
```
This is necessary so the trace units flush intermediate trace packets.

### <u>(1b) Define trace routes from tiles to shimDMA</u>
Once the trace units and shimDMA are configured, we need to define how the trace packets are routed from the tiles to the Shim tile. This is done by declaring packet switched flows using the convenince function `configure_packet_tracing_flow` defined in [python/utils/test.py](../../../python/utils/test.py) and described in more detail in the [README](../../../python/utils) under `python/utils`. This function is declared in the main body of our design as shown below:
```python
    trace_utils.configure_packet_tracing_flow(tiles_to_trace, ShimTile)
```
The arguments for this example are:
* *tiles_to_trace* - array of compute tiles we want to trace
* *ShimTile* - shim tile that the trace is going out to

> **Note** The synchronization of this function with the previous `configure_packet_tracing_aie2` is important because we track the flow IDs and bd numbers of each configured trace. Do not mix and match these with circuit switched routing as they are intended to work together as pair. 

## <u>2. Configure host code to read trace data and write it to a text file</u>

Once the trace units are configured and routed, we want the host code to read the trace data from DDR and write it out to a text file for post-run processing. To give a better sense of how this comes together, this section provides an example design that is again a simplifed version of the [Vector Scalar Multiply example](../../../programming_examples/basic/vector_scalar_mul/).

### <u>AIE structural design code ([aie2.py](./aie2.py))</u>
In order to write the DDR data to a text file, we need to know where in DDR the trace data is stored and then read from that location. This starts inside the [aie2.py](./aie2.py) file where we use the `configure_packet_tracing_aie2` function call to configure the trace units and program the shimDMA to write to one of inout buffers. This requires a more in-depth understanding about the *XRT buffer objects* described in [section 3](../../section-3). There we had described that our XRT supports up to 5 inout buffer objects. Common 1 input, 1 output and 2 input, 1 output patterns maps in the following way where the *group_id* is listed next to each XRT buffer object, `inoutN (group_id)`.

| inout0 (3) | inout1 (4) | 
|--------|--------|
| input A  | output C | 

| inout0 (3) | inout1 (4) | inout2 (5) |
|--------|--------|--------|
| input A  | input B | output C  |

To support trace, we will configure a shim tile to move the trace packet data to DDR through one of these XRT buffer objects. For simplicity, we choose `inout4 (7)` such that the new trace enabled mapping is:

| inout0 (3)| inout1 (4) | inout2 (5) | inout3 (6)| inout4 (7)|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| input A  | output C | unused | unused | trace  |

| inout0 (3)| inout1 (4)| inout2 (5)| inout3 (6)| inout4 (7)|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| input A  | input B | output C | unused | trace  |

In some designs, we have also used a pattern where we share an XRT buffer object where the trace data is written to same buffer object as the output (but with an offset). This is helpful if we do not have a spare buffer object dedicated to trace, but requires precise declaration of offset size.

| inout0 (3)| inout1 (4)| inout2 (5)| 
|--------|--------|--------|
| input A  | input B | (output C + trace) |

When using the convenience python wrappers, where 1 input, 1 output and 2 inputs, 1 output patterns are supported, we choose to map the trace data to `inout4(7)`. More details are described in [python/utils/xrt.py](../../../python/utils/xrt.py) including the option to map trace to a different XRT buffer object with a specified offset. 

Once [aie2.py](./aie2.py) is configured to output trace data to the 5th inout buffer, we turn our attention to the host code to read the DDR data and write it to a file.

> **NOTE** In our example design ([aie2.py](./aie2.py)), we provide a [Makefile](./Makefile) target `run` for standard build and `trace` for trace-enabled build. The trace-enabled build passes the trace buffer size as an argument to [aie2.py](./aie2.py) which conditionally enables the trace `flow` and calls `configure_packet_tracing_aie2` as long as `trace_size` is > 0. This is also true for the [Vector Scalar Multiply example](../../../programming_examples/basic/vector_scalar_mul).

### <u>(2a) C/C++ Host code ([test.cpp](./test.cpp), [../../../runtime_lib/test_lib/xrt_test_wrapper_.h](../../../runtime_lib/test_lib/xrt_test_wrapper.h))</u>
The main changes needed for the host code is declare a buffer object for trace data and pass that buffer object to the XRT kernel function call. This looks like the following snippets of code:

```c
    auto bo_trace = xrt::bo(device, tmp_trace_size, XRT_BO_FLAGS_HOST_ONLY,
                            kernel.group_id(7));

    ...

    char *bufTrace = bo_trace.map<char *>();
    memset(bufTrace, 0, myargs.trace_size);
    bo_trace.sync(XCL_BO_SYNC_BO_TO_DEVICE);

    ...

    auto run = kernel(opcode, bo_instr, instr_v.size(), bo_in1, bo_in2, bo_out, 0, bo_trace);
    bo_trace.sync(XCL_BO_SYNC_BO_FROM_DEVICE);
```
Once the design has been executed. We can then use the convenience function `write_out_trace` to write the buffer contents to a file for post-processing.
```c
    test_utils::write_out_trace((char *)bufTrace, myargs.trace_size, myargs.trace_file);
```

#### Templated host code (test.cpp) 
Because the code patterns for measuring host code timing and configuring trace are so often repeated, they have been further wrapped into the convenience function `setup_and_run_aie` in [xrt_test_wrapper_.h](../../../runtime_lib/test_lib/xrt_test_wrapper.h) which then allows us to create a simpler top level host code [test.cpp](./test.cpp). 

In our template host code [test.cpp](./test.cpp) for 2 inputs and 1 output, we cusotmize the following:
* Input and output buffer size (in bytes) - Specified in the [Makefile](./Makefile) and [CMakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt) and then passed into the [aie2.py](./aie2.py) and [test.cpp](./test.cpp)
    ```Makefile
        in1_size = 16384 # in bytes
        in2_size = 4 # in bytes, should always be 4 (1x int32)
        out_size = 16384 # in bytes, should always be equal to in1_size
    ```
* Buffer data types - Defined in [aie2.py](./aie2.py) and [test.cpp](./test.cpp). The types should match but even if they don't, the buffer size will match and prevent hangs.

    In [aie2.py](./aie2.py):
    ```Python
        in1_dtype = np.int32
        in2_dtype = np.int32
        out_dtype = np.int32
    ```
    In [test.cpp](./test.cpp)
    ```C
        using DATATYPE_IN1 = std::int32_t;
        using DATATYPE_IN2 = std::int32_t;
        using DATATYPE_OUT = std::int32_t;
    ```
* Buffer initialization functions, Verificiation function - Defined in [test.cpp](./test.cpp) and passed into `setup_and_run_aie` as shown below:
    ```C
    // Initialize Input buffer 1
    void initialize_bufIn1(DATATYPE_IN1 *bufIn1, int SIZE) {
    for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
        bufIn1[i] = i + 1;
    }

    // Initialize Input buffer 2
    void initialize_bufIn2(DATATYPE_IN2 *bufIn2, int SIZE) {
    bufIn2[0] = 3; // scaleFactor
    }

    // Initialize Output buffer
    void initialize_bufOut(DATATYPE_OUT *bufOut, int SIZE) {
    memset(bufOut, 0, SIZE);
    }

    // Functional correctness verifyer
    int verify_vector_scalar_mul(DATATYPE_IN1 *bufIn1, DATATYPE_IN2 *bufIn2,
                                DATATYPE_OUT *bufOut, int SIZE, int verbosity) {
    int errors = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
        int32_t ref = bufIn1[i] * bufIn2[0];
        int32_t test = bufOut[i];
        if (test != ref) {
        if (verbosity >= 1)
            std::cout << "Error in output " << test << " != " << ref << std::endl;
        errors++;
        } else {
        if (verbosity >= 1)
            std::cout << "Correct output " << test << " == " << ref << std::endl;
        }
    }
    return errors;
    }
    ```

In the example simplified `vector_scalar_mul` design, we can build the complete design, including the C/C++ host code [test.cpp](./test.cpp) by running:
```bash
make trace
```

### <u>(2b) Python Host code ([test.py](./test.py), [../../../python/utils/xrt.py](../../../python/utils/xrt.py))</u>
In the [Makefile](./Makefile), we also have a `trace_py` target which calls the python host code `test.py` instead of the C/C++ host code `test.cpp`. 

The python equivalent host code performs the same steps as the C/C++ host code as shown below:
```python
    app.register_buffer(7, shape=trace_buf_shape, dtype=trace_buf_dtype)
    full_output, trace_buffer = execute(
        app, in1_data, in2_data, enable_trace, trace_after_output
    )
```
These convenience python wrappers perform the `sync` steps under the hood when the buffers are being written to and read from. Once the trace data has been written to DDR and read into the trace buffer, we can write it out to a file with the following functions:
```python
    trace_buffer = trace_buffer.view(np.uint32)
    write_out_trace(trace_buffer, str(opts.trace_file))
```
Just like the C/C++ host code wrapper `setup_and_run_aie` found in [../../../runtime_lib/test_lib/xrt_test_wrapper_.h](../../../runtime_lib/test_lib/xrt_test_wrapper.h), for python, we have a similar wrapper `setup_and_run_aie` in [../../../python/utils/xrt.py](../../../python/utils/xrt.py). This likewise simplifies the `test.py` and can be used as a template for design patterns.

## <u>3. Parse text file to generate a waveform json file</u>
Once the packet trace text file is generated (`trace.txt`), we use a python-based trace parser ([parse_trace.py](../../../programming_examples/utils/parse_trace.py)) to interpret the trace values and generate a waveform json file for visualization (with Perfetto). This is a step in the [Makefile](./Makefile) but can be executed from the command line as well.
```Makefile
	../../../programming_examples/utils/parse_trace.py --filename trace.txt --mlir build/aie_trace.mlir --colshift 1 > trace_4b.json
```
This leverages the python parse scripts under [programming_examples/utils](../../../programming_examples/utils/). See the [README.md](../../../programming_examples/utils/README.md) to get more details about how to use the python parse scripts.

In our example [Makefile](./Makefile), we also run [get_trace_summary.py](../../../programming_examples/utils/get_trace_summary.py) to analyze the generated JSON trace file to count the number of invocations of the kernel and the cycle count of those invocations. This depends on the kernel having an `event0` and `event1` function call at the beginning and end of the kernel, which our example does. `event0` and `event1` are functions that generate an internal event and is helpful for us to mark the boundaries of a function call.

## <u>4. Open json file in a visualization tool like Perfetto</u>
Open https://ui.perfetto.dev in your browser and then open up the waveform json file generated in step 3. You can navigate the waveform viewer as you would a standard waveform viewer and can even zoom/pan the waveform with the a,s,w,d keyboard keys.

## <u>Additional Debug Hints</u>
* If you are not getting valid trace data out (e.g. empty `trace.txt` or just 0's), then trace packets were not written to a file successfully. There could be a number of reasons for this but some things to check are:
    * Check if `colshift` is correctly specified (should be correct if called from updated `Makefile`). Phoenix (npu) devices should have `colshift=1` while Strix (npu2) should have `colshift=0`.
    * Did you write to the correct XRT buffer object in your source python that the your host code is reading from. For example, calls to `configure_packet_tracing_aie2` writes to `ddr_id=4` or `group_id=7` by default. but some other implementations might share the output buffer (`ddr_id=2` or `group_id=5`) so double check which one is being used.
    * It's possible that a simple core may have too few events to create a valid trace packet. To work around this, you can either (1) add a ShimTile to the array of `[tiles_to_trace]` as well to add more trace data or (2) reduce the shim dma burst length by adding the parameter `shim_burst_length=64` to the call `configure_packet_tracing_aie2`. Valid burst shim burst length for aie2 is 64B, 128B, 256B, 512B. The default burst length for regular data buffers is 256-Bytes but for the trace buffer, it is 64-Bytes instead, which means you only need to define it if it was overwritten elsewhere. This also means that if the trace data is less than 64B, it will not be written out to DDR. Another scenario is that some trace data packets can be missing at the end if it's not am multiple of 64-Bytes.
    * If you're sharing a buffer object for both output and trace, ensure the offset for the trace configuration is the right size (based on output buffer size). Check both size and datatype. Offsets are usually in terms of bytes.
    * The correct tile is being routed to the the correct shim DMA. It's not uncommon in a multi core design to route the wrong tile if you're routing these manually, espeically if the tile names might be very similar. Using the convenience python wrappers should automatically handle this correctly.
    * For designs with packet-routing flows, check for correctly matching packet flow IDs. The packet flow ID must match the configured ID value in Trace Control 1 register or else the packets don't get routed. Using the convenience python wrappers should again automatically handle this correctly. However, if your design uses its own packet-routing flows, the default flow IDs may conflict with the trace ones (to be improved in future release)

## <u>Exercises</u>
1. Let's give tracing a try. In this directory, we will be examining a simplified version of the `vector scalar multiply` example. Run `make trace`. This compiles the design, generates a trace data file, and runs `prase_trace.py` to generate the `trace_4b.json` waveform file.

    > **NOTE** In this example, `make`, `make run` and `make trace` will all build a structural design with tracing enabled to keep things simple. But only `make trace` will enable tracing in the host code and call `parse_trace.py`. In contrast, the reference `vector scalar multiply example` has a more robust `Makefile` where `make` and `make run` build the structural design with tracing disabled.

    Open this waveform json in http://ui.perfetto.dev. If you zoom into the region of interest with the keyboard shortcut keys W and S to zoom in and out respectively and A and D to pan left and right. You should see a wave like the following:

    <img src="../../assets/trace_vector_scalar_mul1.png" title="AIE-ML Vector Unit." height=250>

    Based on this wave, You can mouse over each chunk of continguous data for `PortRunning0` (input dma port) and `PortRunning1` (output dma port). What is the chunk size? <img src="../../../mlir_tutorials/images/answer1.jpg" title="1024" height=25> How many input and output chunks are there? <img src="../../../mlir_tutorials/images/answer1.jpg" title="4 inputs and 4 outputs (last output might be truncated in viewer)" height=25> This should match iteration loop bounds in our example design.

    There are a few common events in our waveform that are described below:
    * `INSTR_EVENT_0` - The event marking the beginning of our kernel. See [vector_scalar_mul.cc](./vector_scalar_mul.cc) where we added the function `event0()` before the loop. This is generally a handy thing to do to attach an event to the beginning of our kernel.
    * `INSTR_EVENT_1` - The event marking the end of our kernel. See [vector_scalar_mul.cc](./vector_scalar_mul.cc) where we added the function `event1()` after the loop. Much like event0, attaching event1 to the end of our kernel is also helpful.
    * `INSTR_VECTOR` - Vector instructions like vector MAC or vector load/store. Here, we are running a scalar implementation so there are no vector events.
    * `PORT_RUNNING_0` up to `PORT_RUNNING_7` - You can listen for a variety of events, such as `PORT_RUNNING`, `PORT_IDLE` or `PORT_STALLED` on up to 7 ports. To select which port to listen to, use the `PortEvent` Python class as your event. For example, to listen to master port 1:
        ```
        from aie.utils.trace import configure_simple_tracing_aie2, PortEvent
        from aie.utils.trace_events_enum import CoreEvent, MemEvent, PLEvent, MemTileEvent
        trace_utils.configure_simple_tracing_aie2(
            # ... other arguments as above
            events=[trace_utils.PortEvent(CoreEvent.PORT_RUNNING_0, 1, master=True)]
        )
        ```
    * `PORT_RUNNING_1` - Mapped to Port 1 which is by default configured to the MM2S0 output (DMA from local memory to stream). This is usually the first output.
    * `LOCK_STALL` - Any locks stalls.
    * `INSTR_LOCK_ACQUIRE_REQ` - Any lock acquire requests.
    * `INSTR_LOCK_RELEASE_REQ` - Any lock release requests.

    We will look at more exercises with Trace and performance measurement in the next [section](../section-4c).
