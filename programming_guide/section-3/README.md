# <ins>Section 3 - My First Program</ins>

In this section, we'll put together what you learend in [section-1](../section-1) for defining a basic strucutral design in python and combine it with the data movement part from [section-2](../section-2) to build our first program. We will then run a simulation on this program as well as run this design on hardware (Ryzen AI).

* Introduce example of first simple program (Bias Add)
    * Walk through syntax of aie2.py, test.cpp, test_utils.h, maybe CMakeLists.txt and Makefile/ makefile-common as well
    * need to remove trace parts from test.cpp for now and move it to Section-4

* Illustrate how built-in simulation of single core design
* Illustrate how to run designs on Ryzen AI enabled hardware
