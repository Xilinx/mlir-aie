# <ins>Section 5 - Example Vector Designs</ins>

The [programming examples](../../programming_examples) are a number of sample designs that further help explain many of the unique features of AI Engines and the NPU array in Ryzenâ„¢ AI.

## Simplest

#### Passthrough

The [passthrough](../../programming_examples/basic/passthrough_kernel/) example is the simplest "getting started" example.  It copies 4096 bytes from the input to output using vectorized loads and stores.  The design example shows a typical project organization which is easy to reproduce with other examples.  There are only really 4 important files here.
1. [`aie2.py`](../../programming_examples/basic/passthrough_kernel/aie2.py) The AIE structural design which includes the shim tile connected to the external memory, and a single AIE core for performing the copy.  It also shows a simple use of the ObjectFIFOs described in [section 2](../section-2).
1. [`passthrough.cc`](../../aie_kernels/generic/passThrough.cc)  This is a C++ file which performs the vectorized copy operation.
1. [`test.cpp`](../../programming_examples/basic/passthrough_kernel/test.cpp) or [`test.py`](../../programming_examples/basic/passthrough_kernel/test.py) A C++ or Python main application for exercising the design, and comparing against a CPU reference
1. [`Makefile`](../../programming_examples/basic/passthrough_kernel/Makefile) A Makefile documenting (and implementing) the build process for the various artifacts.

The [passthrough DMAs](../../programming_examples/basic/passthrough_dmas/) example shows an alternate method of performing a copy without involving the cores, and instead performing a loopback.

## Exercises

1. Can you modify the [passthrough](../../programming_examples/basic/passthrough_kernel/) design to copy more (or less) data? <img src="../../mlir_tutorials/images/answer1.jpg" title="Check the Makefile...PASSTHROUGH_SIZE" height=25>

1. Take a look at the testbench in our [Vector Exp](../../programming_examples/basic/vector_exp/) example [test.cpp](../../programming_examples/basic/vector_exp/test.cpp). Take note of the data type and the size of the test vector. What do you notice? <img src="../../mlir_tutorials/images/answer1.jpg" title="We are testing 65536 values or 2^16, therefore testing all possible bfloat16 values through the approximation." height=25>

1. What is the communication-to-computation  ratio in [ReLU](../../programming_examples/ml/relu/)? <img src="../../mlir_tutorials/images/answer1.jpg" title="~6 as reported by the Trace. This is why it is a good candiate for kernel fusion with Conv2D or GEMMs for ML." height=25>

1. **HARD** Which basic example is a component in [Softmax](../../programming_examples/ml/softmax/)? <img src="../../mlir_tutorials/images/answer1.jpg" title="[Vector Exp](../../programming_examples/basic/vector_exp/)" height=25>
