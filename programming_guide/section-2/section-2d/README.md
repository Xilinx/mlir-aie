In the preceding sections, we looked at how we can describe data movement between tiles *within* the AIE-array. However, to do anything useful, we need to get data from outside the array, i.e., from the "host", into the AIE-array and back. On NPU devices, we can achieve this with the operations described in this section. 

The operations that will be described in this section must be placed in a separate `sequence()` of a `Runtime` class, or `aie.runtime_sequence` operation at the explicitly placed IRON level. The arguments to this function describe buffers that will be available on the host side; the body of the function describes how those buffers are moved into the AIE-array. [Section 3](../../section-3/) contains an example.

### Guide to Managing Runtime Data Movement to/from Host Memory

In high-performance computing applications, efficiently managing data movement and synchronization is crucial. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to utilize IRON to manage data movement at runtime from/to host memory to/from the AIE array (for example, in the Ryzenâ„¢ AI NPU).

For high-level IRON constructs like `RuntimeTasks`, please continue with this [reading](./RuntimeTasks.md).

For explicitly placed, closer-to-metal IRON API functions like `npu_dma_memcpy_nd` and `dma_wait` please continue reading [here](./DMATasks.md).
