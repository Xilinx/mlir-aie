# <ins>Hands-on Tutorial for IRON 0.9</ins>

## <ins>Key Components: ObjectFifos, Workers, Runtime</ins>

IRON 0.9 introduces an unplaced layer to the IRON [API](../../python/iron/). As an example, below are the placed and unplaced versions of the AIE Object FIFOs and compute code:

Placed Object FIFO: 
```python
line_size = 256
line_type = np.ndarray[(line_size,), np.dtype[np.int32]]

A = tile(1, 3)
B = tile(2, 4)
of_in = object_fifo("in", A, B, 2, line_type)
```
Unplaced Object FIFO:
```python
# Define tensor types
line_size = 256
line_type = np.ndarray[(line_size,), np.dtype[np.int32]]

# Dataflow with ObjectFifos
of_in = ObjectFifo(line_type, name="in") # default_depth is 2
```
More on the Object FIFO in [Section 2a](../section-2/section-2a/README.md) of the programming guide.

Placed compute code: 
```python
ComputeTile1 = tile(1, 3)
buff_in = buffer(ComputeTile1, data_ty, name="buff")

@core(ComputeTile1)
def core_body():
    for i in range_(data_size):
        buff_in[i] = buff_in[i] + 1
```
Unplaced compute code:
```python
buff = GlobalBuffer(data_ty, name="buff")

def core_fn(buff_in):
    for i in range_(data_size):
        buff_in[i] = buff_in[i] + 1

# Create a worker to perform the task
my_worker = Worker(core_fn, [buff]) # enforced placement: placement=Tile(1, 3)
```

We will now look at a code [example](./aie2.py) of IRON 0.9 and observe the different parts of the design.

## <u>Exercises</u>
1. Familiarize yourself with [exercise_1](./exercise_1/aie2.py). The code contains a single Worker which has an already instantiated local buffer that it sends out to external memory. Run `make run` to run the program and verify the output.

2. Run `make clean`. Modify the code in [exercise_1](./exercise_1/aie2.py) so that the Worker receives its input data from external memory instead of using the local buffer, i.e. a passthrough.

3. Run `make clean`. Modify the code in [exercise_1](./exercise_1/aie2.py) so that data is routed from external memory through a Mem tile and back only using ObjectFifos and without using Workers. For this, you will require the `forward()` function defined in [objectfifo.py](../../python/iron/dataflow/objectfifo.py).

## <ins>Complex Data Movement Patterns: Broadcast, Split, Join</ins>

IRON 0.9 designs can be scaled to use multiple Workers easily: 
```python
n_workers = 4

def core_fn(...):
    # ...kernel code...

# Create workers to perform the tasks
workers = []
for _ in range(n_workers):
    workers.append(
        Worker(core_fn, [...])
    )

rt = Runtime()
with rt.sequence(data_ty, data_ty, data_ty) as (_, _, _):
    rt.start(*workers)
```
Complex data movement patterns such as broadcast, split or join are supported using the `ObjectFifo`. In particular the `ObjectFifoHandles`, which can be either producer or consumer handles, are used to determine a broadcast pattern with multiple consumers:
```python
n_workers = 4

# Define tensor types
line_size = 256
line_type = np.ndarray[(line_size,), np.dtype[np.int32]]

# Dataflow with ObjectFifos
of_in = ObjectFifo(line_type, name="in")

def core_fn(of_in):
    # ...kernel code...

# Create workers to perform the tasks
workers = []
for _ in range(n_workers):
    workers.append(
        Worker(core_fn, [of_in.cons()])
    )
```

The `split` and `join` methods are used to create multiple output and input `ObjectFifos` respectively.
    
Split:
```python
n_workers = 4

# Define tensor types
line_size = 256
line_type = np.ndarray[(line_size,), np.dtype[np.int32]]
tile_size = line_size // n_workers
tile_ty = np.ndarray[(tile_size,), np.dtype[np.int32]]

# Dataflow with ObjectFifos
of_offsets = [tile_size * worker for worker in range(n_workers)]

of_in = ObjectFifo(data_ty, name="in")
of_ins = of_in.cons().split(
    of_offsets,
    obj_types=[tile_ty] * n_workers,
    names=[f"in{worker}" for worker in range(n_workers)],
)

def core_fn(of_in):
    # ...kernel code...

# Create workers to perform the tasks
workers = []
for worker in range(n_workers):
    workers.append(
        Worker(core_fn, [of_ins[worker].cons()])
    )
```

Join:
```python
n_workers = 4

# Define tensor types
line_size = 256
line_type = np.ndarray[(line_size,), np.dtype[np.int32]]
tile_size = line_size // n_workers
tile_ty = np.ndarray[(tile_size,), np.dtype[np.int32]]

# Dataflow with ObjectFifos
of_offsets = [tile_size * worker for worker in range(n_workers)]

of_out = ObjectFifo(data_ty, name="out")
of_outs = of_out.prod().join(
    of_offsets,
    obj_types=[tile_ty] * n_workers,
    names=[f"out{worker}" for worker in range(n_workers)],
)

def core_fn(of_out):
    # ...kernel code...

# Create workers to perform the tasks
workers = []
for worker in range(n_workers):
    workers.append(
        Worker(core_fn, [of_outs[worker].prod()])
    )
```

## <u>Exercises</u>
4. Familiarize yourself with [exercise_2](./exercise_2/aie2.py). Modify the code in [exercise_2](./exercise_2/aie2.py) so that the input data is split between three workers and their outputs are joined before the final result is sent to external memory.

## <ins>Runtime Parameters and Barriers</ins>

IRON 0.9 also supports the use of Runtime Parameters which are set and propagated to the Workers at runtime.
```python
n_workers = 4

# Runtime parameters
rtps = []
for i in range(n_workers):
    rtps.append(
        GlobalBuffer(
            np.ndarray[(16,), np.dtype[np.int32]],
            name=f"rtp{i}",
            use_write_rtp=True,
        )
    )

def core_fn(rtp):
    runtime_parameter = rtp

# Create workers to perform the tasks
workers = []
for worker in range(n_workers):
    workers.append(
        Worker(core_fn, [rtps[worker]])
    )

rt = Runtime()
with rt.sequence(data_ty, data_ty, data_ty) as (_, _, _):

    # Set runtime parameters
    def set_rtps(*args):
        for rtp in args:
            rtp[0] = 50
            rtp[1] = 255
            rtp[2] = 0

    rt.inline_ops(set_rtps, rtps)
```
To ensure that RTPs are not read prematurely, IRON 0.9 introduces `WorkerRuntimeBarriers` which can be used to synchronize a Worker with the runtime sequence:
```python
n_workers = 4

# Runtime parameters
# ...

# Worker runtime barriers
workerBarriers = []
for _ in range(n_workers):
    workerBarriers.append(WorkerRuntimeBarrier())

def core_fn(rtp, barrier):
    barrier.wait_for_value(1)
    runtime_parameter = rtp

# Create workers to perform the tasks
workers = []
for worker in range(n_workers):
    workers.append(
        Worker(core_fn, [rtps[worker], workerBarriers[worker]])
    )

rt = Runtime()
with rt.sequence(data_ty, data_ty, data_ty) as (_, _, _):
    # Set runtime parameters
    # ...
    rt.inline_ops(set_rtps, rtps)
    
    for worker in range(n_workers):
        rt.set_barrier(workerBarriers[worker], 1)
```

## <u>Exercises</u>
5. Familiarize yourself with [exercise_3](./exercise_3/aie2.py). Run `make run`. 

6. The design fails because the Worker reads the RTP before the runtime sets it. Modify the code in [exercise_3](./exercise_3/aie2.py) such that the Worker uses a `WorkerRuntimeBarrier` to wait for the RTP to be set.

## <ins>Advanced Topic: Data Layout Transformations</ins>

`ObjectFifo`s can express DMA on-the-fly data transformations via their `dims_to_stream` and `default_dims_from_stream_per_cons` inputs. These inputs are structured as a list of pairs where each pair is expressed as (size, stride) for a dimension of the DMA transformation. The dimensions should be given from highest to lowest.

```python
dims = [(size_2, stride_2), (size_1, stride_1), (size_0, stride_0)]
of_out = ObjectFifo(data_ty, name="out", dims_to_stream=dims)
```
Offsets are currently not represented at the Object FIFO level and as such the dimensions should be applicable over the full size of the objects.

To better support DMA on-the-fly data transformations **at runtime** IRON 0.9 introduces [taplib](../../python/helpers/taplib/) which provides the building blocks for `Tensor Access Pattern`s (`taps`). Unlike the dimensions of the `ObjectFifo` the sizes and strides are grouped together, however, the dimensions should still be given from highest to lowest.

```python
tap = TensorAccessPattern(
    tensor_dims=(2, 3),
    offset=0,
    sizes=[size_1, size_0],
    strides=[stride_1, stride_0],
)
```
`taps` additionally have an offset and as such the `tensor_dims` may be smaller than the size of the original tensor.

The `TensorAccessPattern` can be visualized in two ways:
- as a heatmap showing the order that elements are accessed
- as a heatmap showing the number of times each element in the tensor is accessed by the `TensorAccessPattern`

```python
tap.visualize(show_arrows=True, plot_access_count=True)
```

`taps` can be grouped in a `TensorAccessSequence` where each `tap` represents a different tile (from the tiling pattern):

```python
t0 = TensorAccessPattern((8, 8), offset=0, sizes=[1, 1, 4, 4], strides=[0, 0, 8, 1])
t1 = TensorAccessPattern((8, 8), offset=4, sizes=[1, 1, 4, 4], strides=[0, 0, 8, 1])
t2 = TensorAccessPattern((8, 8), offset=32, sizes=[1, 1, 4, 4], strides=[0, 0, 8, 1])

taps = TensorAccessSequence.from_taps([t0, t1, t2])
```
The `taps` can then be accessed in the sequence as an array:
```python
for t in taps:
```

`taplib` additionally introduces the `TensorTiler2D` class which can generate `taps` for common tiling patterns. The tiler returns the generated `taps` as a `TensorAccessSequence`.

```python
tensor_dims = (8, 8)
tile_dims = (4, 4)
simple_tiler = TensorTiler2D.simple_tiler(tensor_dims, tile_dims)
```

More on `taplib` in [tiling_exploration](../../programming_examples/basic/tiling_exploration/README.md).

## <u>Exercises</u>
7. Familiarize yourself with [exercise_4a](./exercise_4/exercise_4a/aie2.py). Complete the missing sizes and strides such that the DMA transformation of `of_out` matches the one shown in [plot.png](./exercise_4/exercise_4a/plot.png). Run `make run` to verify your answer.

8. Familiarize yourself with [exercise_4b](./exercise_4/exercise_4b/aie2.py). Complete the missing sizes and strides such that the DMA transformation performed on the input data at runtime matches the one in [exercise_4a](./exercise_4/exercise_4a/aie2.py). Run `make run` to verify your answer.

9. Familiarize yourself with [exercise_4c](./exercise_4/exercise_4c/aie2.py). Observe how the `taps` in the `TensorAccessSequence` differ slightly from the one in [exercise_4b](./exercise_4/exercise_4b/aie2.py). Run `make run` and observe the two generated plots.

10. Familiarize yourself with [exercise_4d](./exercise_4/exercise_4d/aie2.py). Complete the missing inputs in the `TensorTiler2D` to match the `TensorAccessPatterns` from the previous exercises. For this, you will require the `simple_tiler()` constructor defined in [tensortiler2d.py](../../python/helpers/taplib/tensortiler2d.py). Run `make run` to verify your answer. You can also observe the two generated plots.
