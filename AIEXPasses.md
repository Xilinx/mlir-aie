### `-aie-create-cores`: Create CoreOp, MemOp, and FlowOp of AIE dialect
Lower toplevel 'call' operations with implicit data movement into
aie.core, aie.mem, and aie.flow operations with explicit data
movement.  The tile tile associated with the operations is inferred
based on the aie.x and aie.y attributes of the call operation. e.g.:
```
func.func @aie_task(%arg0: memref<256xi32>, %arg1: i32) -> () {
  ...
  return
}
%a = constant 0 : i32
func.call @aie_task(%buf, %a) { aie.x = 1, aie.y = 1 } : (memref<256xi32>, i32) -> ()

```
will result in:
```
%0 = AIE.tile(1, 1)
%1 = AIE.buffer(%0) : memref<256xi32>
%2 = AIE.buffer(%0) : memref<1xi32>
%c0_i32 = constant 0 : i32
%5 = AIE.core(%0) {
  ...
}
```
In this case, each argument to aie_task results in an explicit buffer accessed by the core.

### `-aie-create-locks`: Generate physical lock ops from logical lock (token) ops
Tokens represent high-level buffer synchronization through a sequence of
pipeline stages.  This pass lowers token operations into physical aie.lock
operations.
### `-aie-herd-routing`: Lowering herds with place and route ops to AIE cores, mems, and switchboxes
An experimental pass which elaborates herd operations (e.g. aie.herd, aie.iter, aie.select)
into an explicit representation (e.g. aie.core, aie.mem, etc.).
### `-aie-lower-broadcast-packet`: Replace combination of broadcast and packet-switch by packet-flow
Replace combination of broadcast and packet-switch by packet-flow
### `-aie-lower-memcpy`: Lower aie.memcpy operations to Flows and DMA programs
aie.memcpy operations are an experimental high-level abstraction which
move data from one buffer to another.
This pass lowers them into appropriate aie.flow and aie.mem operations.
### `-aie-lower-multicast`: Lower AIE.multicast operation to AIE.flow operations
This pass replaces AIE.multicast operation with the equivalent number of AIE.flow
operations. The lowered AIE.flow operations have the same source port but different
destinations.
