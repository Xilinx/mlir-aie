# Experimental Example

This example showcases what a higher-level (above IRON) syntax might look like one day for programming NPUs. It is designed to be at a similar level of abstraction to cupy.
Run the design with:
```bash
./example.py
```

Warning: This example is very brittle. The support for this syntax is strictly proof-of-concept and any changes to the design will likely be beyond what the current implementation supports.
