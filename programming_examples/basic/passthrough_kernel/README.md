# Passthrough Kernel:

This IRON design flow example, called "Passthrough Kernel", demonstrates a simple AIE implementation for vectorized memcpy on a vector of integers. In this design, a single AIE core performs the memcpy operation on a vector with a default length `4096`. The kernel is configured to work on `1024` element-sized subvectors and is invoked multiple times to complete the full copy. The example consists of two primary design files: `aie2.py` and `passThrough.cc`, and a testbench `test.cpp` or `test.py`.

## Source Files Overview

1. `aie2.py`: A Python script that defines the AIE array structural design using MLIR-AIE operations. The file generates MLIR that is then compiled using `aiecc.py` to produce design binaries (ie. XCLBIN and inst.txt for the NPU in Ryzenâ„¢ AI). 

1. `passThrough.cc`: A C++ implementation of vectorized memcpy operations for AIE cores. Found [here](../../../aie_kernels/generic/passThrough.cc).

1. `test.cpp`: This C++ code is a testbench for the Passthrough Kernel design example. The code is responsible for loading the compiled XCLBIN file, configuring the AIE module, providing input data, and executing the AIE design on the NPU. After executing, the script verifies the memcpy results and optionally outputs trace data.

1. `test.py`: This Python code is a testbench for the Passthrough Kernel design example. The code is responsible for loading the compiled XCLBIN file, configuring the AIE module, providing input data, and executing the AIE design on the NPU. After executing, the script verifies the memcpy results and optionally outputs trace data.

## Design Overview

<img align="right" width="300" height="300" src="../../../programming_guide/assets/passthrough_simple.svg"> 

This simple example effectively passes data through a single compute tile in the NPU's AIE array. The design is described as shown in the figure to the right. The overall design flow is as follows:
1. An object FIFO called "of_in" connects a Shim Tile to a Compute Tile, and another called "of_out" connects the Compute Tile back to the Shim Tile. 
1. The runtime data movement is expressed to read `4096` uint8_t data from host memory to the compute tile and write the `4096` data back to host memory. 
1. The compute tile acquires this input data in "object" sized (`1024`) blocks from "of_in" and copies them to another output "object" it has acquired from "of_out". Note that a vectorized kernel running on the Compute Tile's AIE core copies the data from the input "object" to the output "object".
1. After the vectorized copy is performed, the Compute Tile releases the "objects", allowing the DMAs (abstracted by the object FIFO) to transfer the data back to host memory and copy additional blocks into the Compute Tile,  "of_out" and "of_in" respectively.

It is important to note that the Shim Tile and Compute Tile DMAs move data concurrently, and the Compute Tile's AIE Core also processes data concurrently with the data movement. This is made possible by expressing depth `2` in declaring, for example, `object_fifo("in", ShimTile, ComputeTile2, 2, memRef_ty)` to denote ping-pong buffers.

## Design Component Details

### AIE Array Structural Design

This design performs a memcpy operation on a vector of input data. The AIE design is described in a Python module as follows:

1. **Constants & Configuration:** The script defines input/output dimensions (`N`, `n`), buffer sizes in `lineWidthInBytes` and `lineWidthInInt32s`, and tracing support.

1. **AIE Device Definition:** `@device` defines the target device. The `device_body` function contains the AIE array design definition.

1. **Kernel Function Declarations:** `passThroughLine` is an external function imported from `passThrough.cc`.

1. **Tile Definitions:** `ShimTile` handles data movement, and `ComputeTile2` processes the memcpy operations.

1. **Object Fifos:** `of_in` and `of_out` are defined to facilitate communication between `ShimTile` and `ComputeTile2`.

1. **Tracing Flow Setup (Optional):** A circuit-switched flow is set up for tracing information when enabled.

1. **Core Definition:** The `core_body` function loops through sub-vectors of the input data, acquiring elements from `of_in`, processing using `passThroughLine`, and outputting the result to `of_out`.

1. **Data Movement Configuration:** The `sequence` function configures data movement and synchronization on the `ShimTile` for input and output buffer management.

1. **Tracing Configuration (Optional):** Trace control, event groups, and buffer descriptors are set up in the `sequence` function when tracing is enabled.

1. **Generate the design:** The `passthroughKernel()` function triggers the code generation process. The final print statement outputs the MLIR representation of the AIE array configuration.

### AIE Core Kernel Code

`passThrough.cc` contains a C++ implementation of vectorized memcpy operation designed for AIE cores. It consists of two main sections:

1. **Vectorized Copying:** The `passThrough_aie()` function processes multiple data elements simultaneously, taking advantage of AIE vector datapath capabilities to load, copy and store data elements.

1. **C-style Wrapper Functions:** `passThroughLine()` and `passThroughTile()` are two C-style wrapper functions to call the templated `passThrough_aie()` vectorized memcpy implementation from the AIE design implemented in `aie2.py`. The `passThroughLine()` and `passThroughTile()` functions are compiled for `uint8_t`, `int16_t`, or `int32_t` determined by the value the `BIT_WIDTH` variable defines.
