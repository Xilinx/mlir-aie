# <ins>Simple Repeat</ins>

This reference design can be run on a Ryzenâ„¢ AI NPU.

In the [design](./aie2.py) data is brought from external memory via the `ShimTile` to the `MemTile` and back by using an implicit copy via the compute tile's Data Movement Accelerator (DMA). Furthermore, the input data is repeated by the `MemTile` three times which results in the output data consisting of four instances of the input data.

The implicit copy is performed using the `object_fifo_link` operation that specifies how input data arriving via `of_in` should be sent further via `of_out` by specifically leveraging the compute tile's DMA. This operation and its functionality are described in more depth in [Section-2b](../../../programming_guide/section-2/section-2b/03_Link_Distribute_Join/README.md#object-fifo-link) of the programming guide.

The repeat count is specified as follows:
```
of_out.set_memtile_repeat(3)
```
Specifically, the instruction above specifies the number of repetitions that the producer side of the `of_out` objectfifo should do.

To compile and run the design for NPU:
```
make
make run
```
