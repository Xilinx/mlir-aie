# <ins>Passthrough DMAs</ins>

This reference design can be run on a Ryzenâ„¢ AI NPU.

In the [design](./aie2.py) data is brought from external memory to `ComputeTile2` and back, without modification from the tile, by using an implicit copy via the compute tile's Data Movement Accelerator (DMA). The data is read from and written to external memory through the Shim tile (`col`, 0).

The implicit copy is performed using the `object_fifo_link` operation that specifies how input data arriving via `of_in` should be sent further via `of_out` by specifically leveraging the compute tile's DMA. This operation and its functionality are described in more depth in [Section-2b](../../../programming_guide/section-2/section-2b/03_Link_Distribute_Join/README.md#object-fifo-link) of the programming guide.


To compile and run the design for NPU:
```
make
make run
```
