# Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) Example

This design implements a `bfloat16`-based Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) operation, a widely used technique in deep learning models, especially in transformer architectures. LayerNorm normalizes the activations of each input across the features (columns) for every row, stabilizing and accelerating the training process by reducing internal covariate shift. 
## Files

- `layernorm.py` : A Python script that defines the AIE array structural design using MLIR-AIE operations. This generates MLIR that is then compiled using aiecc.py to produce design binaries (i.e., XCLBIN and inst.bin for the NPU in Ryzenâ„¢ AI).

- `layernorm.cc` : A C++ implementation of a LayerNorm kernel for AIE cores. The code uses the AIE API, which is a C++ header-only library providing types and operations that get translated into efficient low-level intrinsics. The source can be found [here](../../../aie_kernels/aie2p/layer_norm.cc).

- `test.cpp` : C++ testbench that initializes input buffers, runs the AIE kernel, and verifies the output against a software reference implementation.

## Parameters

- `rows` / `ROWS`: Number of rows in the input tensor (typically the batch or sequence length)
- `cols` / `COLS`: Number of columns in the input tensor (feature or embedding dimension)
- `trace_size`: Size of the trace buffer (for debugging/profiling)

## Usage

### C++ Testbench

To compile the design and C++ testbench:
```shell
make
```

To run the design:
```shell
make run
```

## Notes

- Two LayerNorm kernel implementations are provided: one uses a standard approach, and the other employs Welford's algorithm for improved numerical stability.

- The standard approach is designed for multi-core execution and accesses values row-wise, allowing each core to process different rows in parallel.

- The Welford implementation gains parallelism within a core by accessing data in column-major order across at least 16 rows, so each vector register holds values from one column. This enables fully vectorized mean and variance updates for multiple rows. Currently, this column-major parallelism is implemented only for single-core execution.

## To-Do

- Extend the Welford-based LayerNorm implementation to support multi-core execution on the AIE array and also to support `bfloat16` datatype.
