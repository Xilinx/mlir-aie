# YOLO26n-cls (INT8) on AI Engine (IRON)

End-to-end YOLO26n classification inference on the AMD Strix Point NPU2
(8-column × 6-row array: row 0 shim DMA, row 1 memtile, rows 2–5 the
4 compute-tile rows = 32 compute tiles total), implemented in the
high-level IRON Python API. All 11 blocks (`m0..m10`) run depth-first
across the array, keeping intermediate activations on-chip, and emit
classification probabilities **bit-exactly matching the Quark XINT8 ONNX
reference**.

The full int8 quantization recipe lives in [`notebooks/`](notebooks): a
FP32 YOLO26n-cls PyTorch checkpoint → FP32 ONNX → AMD Quark XINT8 PTQ →
the deployment ONNX shipped in [`models/`](models).

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Activate the standard mlir-aie environment.
source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh
source ../../../ironenv/bin/activate
source ../../../utils/env_setup.sh ../../../install

# 1b. Install the ML extras (onnx + onnxruntime + torch). The standard
#     mlir-aie env install only pulls requirements.txt + requirements_dev.txt;
#     `make data` and the ORT bit-exact tests need this file too.
pip install -r ../../../python/requirements_ml.txt

# 2. List available targets.
make help

# 3. Extract per-block weight / bias / SiLU LUT bins from the shipped XINT8 ONNX.
make data

# 4. Bit-exact-check a single block on the NPU.
make BLOCK=m8 run_ort

# 5. Bit-exact-check the full chain on the NPU.
make run_chain                          # N=1, single-sample latency mode
CHAIN_N_SAMPLES=15 make run_chain       # batched throughput mode

# 6. Time it.
make BLOCK=m8 time                      # per-block (median ms + fps)
make time_chain                         # chain N=1
CHAIN_N_SAMPLES=15 make time_chain      # chain N=15
```

`make data` is idempotent; the resulting `data/` tree is ~2 MB of
per-layer bins (gitignored).

## Performance (Strix HW, bit-exact vs ORT)

All measurements taken with the NPU in turbo mode
(`sudo xrt-smi configure --pmode turbo`).

**Chain — full sweep, post-audit.** Every prefix m0..mN measured at
N=1/4/15 via `CHAIN_BLOCKS=… make time_chain`. ms columns are per-sample
(N=1 == single-dispatch wall, N>1 == per-sample throughput); fps =
1000 / per-sample-ms. Full chain m0..m10 N=15 is bit-exact vs ORT.

| Chain | N=1 ms | N=1 fps | N=4 ms | N=4 fps | N=15 ms | N=15 fps |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| m0                     | 11.13 | 89.81 | 11.06 | 90.45 | 11.01 | 90.81 |
| m0..m1                 | 11.20 | 89.29 | 11.07 | 90.33 | 11.02 | 90.78 |
| m0..m2                 | 13.19 | 75.81 | 12.82 | 78.01 | 12.66 | 78.99 |
| m0..m3                 | 13.27 | 75.34 | 12.78 | 78.23 | 12.66 | 78.96 |
| m0..m4                 | 13.95 | 71.70 | 12.96 | 77.17 | 12.71 | 78.68 |
| m0..m5                 | 14.10 | 70.91 | 12.99 | 77.01 | 12.72 | 78.59 |
| m0..m6                 | 16.02 | 62.44 | 13.48 | 74.18 | 12.85 | 77.83 |
| m0..m7                 | 16.27 | 61.45 | 13.53 | 73.92 | 12.87 | 77.72 |
| m0..m8                 | 22.94 | 43.59 | 16.90 | 59.17 | 15.43 | 64.80 |
| m0..m9                 | 26.80 | 37.32 | 17.87 | 55.95 | 15.69 | 63.73 |
| **m0..m10 (FULL)**     | **32.17** | **31.08** | **19.22** | **52.03** | **16.05** | **62.32** |

Every chain prefix through m0..m7 sits above 70 fps at N=15. The full
m0..m10 chain crosses 60 fps at N=15 (62.32 fps). m6 was hanging at
runtime before the upstream IRON ObjectFifo depth-collapse fix
(PR #3096) was cherry-picked into this branch — multi-consumer fanout
fifos were silently being sized to ping-pong (2 buffers) instead of
the declared depth, deadlocking c3k2_heavy's bot_fifo broadcast.

m9 is supported standalone via `M9_STAGE=N make BLOCK=m9 run_ort` —
stage 1 compares against `/model.9/cv1/act` post-SiLU; stage 10 (default)
compares against `/model.9/cv2/act` post-SiLU. Intermediate stages emit
PSA-internal tensors with no clean ORT analog; verify those via
`make run_chain`. m10 (head) still standalone-unsupported; covered by
the chain test.

### Exemplar kernel playbook

Every active kernel in this design was audited against a 10-item
optimization playbook. Items applied where structurally compatible:

1. **Constexpr trip counts** for the kernel's known call site (eliminates
   `__divsi3` / `__divsf3` software-math calls in the elf; folds address
   arithmetic into immediates). Verified by `llvm-nm | grep __div`.
2. **Bias-init the mmul accumulator** (8 int32 biases -> 32-wide
   `acc<acc32>` via `concat(b8,b8) -> concat -> from_vector`). Replaces
   per-element scalar bias add.
3. **Vec `to_vector<int8>(rs)` SRS** with `set_rounding(conv_even)` to
   match the scalar `banker_srs` reference. Replaces scalar SRS+clamp tail.
4. **`aie::inv(float)`** for unavoidable fp reciprocals (HW intrinsic;
   single op vs `__divsf3` ~80 cycles). Used in m9 attn_score and m10
   softmax.
5. **Vec mac/mul** in inner loops (mmul.mac or aie::mac).
6. **mmul<8,8,8>** over `<4,8,8>` only where it pays - confirmed on
   pair_cv1 (m8); regresses on 1x1 and stride-2 stem (m0 tried + reverted).
7. **Hoisted vec input gather** for kernels with KW x KH > 1 mac groups
   per pix load (3x3 stride-1 only - stride-2 has non-contiguous cols,
   1x1 doesn't amortize).
8. **`AIE_LOOP_RANGE` + `AIE_LOOP_UNROLL_FULL` hints** on every
   non-trivial loop (requires `aie_kernel_utils.h`).
9. **Compile-time shape macros** (`SHAPES_ARE_CONST` pattern) for
   kernels with multiple call-site shapes. Now wired on every kernel
   that benefits from it: c3k2_small {m2, m4}; chunked stride-2 {m3,
   m5, m7}; c3k2_heavy m6 (cv1_split, cv2_concat3, inner_pair_cv1,
   inner_pair_cv2_skip, m_0_split, cv3_concat2); m9 qkv. Kernels that
   were already constexpr-hardcoded under a different convention
   (proj_skip_row, pe_add_row, m10 trio) provide the same effect.
10. **Bank-aware memory** (address-space-qualified pointer types per
    `example.h` `IFM_DM_BANK` pattern) - **not yet applied**;
    cross-cutting work that requires IRON-side
    `Buffer(..., placement=bank_N)` API + kernel-side
    `__attribute__((address_space(N)))` aliases.

**Known peano AIE2P codegen bug.** `accum<acc32, 16>::to_vector<int8>(shift)`
and `accum<acc32, 32>::to_vector<int8>(shift)` crash in
`getCombinedOpcodeUNPACKLoad` during InstructionSelect when the acc
comes from an `aie::mul`/`aie::mac` chain (not from `mmul.mac`).
64-wide acc survives. Workaround: keep the affected tail scalar, or
widen the acc to 64 via concat-with-zeros. Affects m9 attn_score,
proj_skip_row, ffn_1_skip_row, pe_add_row (all use scalar tail for
the second SRS).

### Biggest per-block wins from the audit

| Block | Pre-audit fps | Post-audit fps | Driver |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| m9 stage 10 |  91.6 | 202.2 | `pe_add_row` vec dw3x3; then qkv SHAPES_ARE_CONST |
| m1          | 116.1 | 206.6 | `conv2dk3_stride2` bias-init + vec SRS |
| m3          | 124.9 | 195.1 | `conv2dk3_stride2_chunked` bias-init + vec SRS |
| m5          | 139.5 | 185.1 | same |
| m7          | 206.8 | 253.7 | same |
| m6          |  66.9 |  83.1 | c3k2_heavy bias-init + vec SRS; then SHAPES_ARE_CONST on all 6 m6 kernels |
| m0          |  76.4 |  88.3 | stem bias-init + vec SRS |
| m4          |  75.2 |  79.5 | c3k2_small (4 shared kernels) bias-init |
| m2          |  69.7 |  77.0 | same |

m8 (61.3 fps) and m10 (130.1 fps) were already deep-opt'd in an earlier
m8/m9/m10 sweep that preceded the kernel-by-kernel audit.

### Next remaining levers

1. **`mmul<8,8,8>` on m6 inner_pair_cv1 / cv2_skip** - same upgrade m8
   pair_cv1 (streamed) already uses. Doubles per-cycle MAC throughput
   on m6's biggest kernel (4.83 ms intrinsic, 70% of m6 wall).
2. **Winograd F(2,3) on 3×3 stride-1** - potential 2.25× MAC reduction
   on the dominant kernel family (m6 inner_pair_*, m8 pair_cv1). INT8
   bit-exactness against the Quark ONNX reference needs an empirical
   numerical-drift study first; if it diverges, bfp16 Winograd via
   the ATB-style framework is the fallback.
3. **ATB-style L1 asymmetry on m9 GEMMs** (paper:
   [arXiv:2511.16041](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16041), reference
   example at `programming_examples/ml/block_datatypes/gemm_asymmetric_tile_buffering/`).
   Demonstrated 31.3 TFLOPS on the same Strix HX 370 silicon — large
   headroom on m9 qkv/proj/ffn0/ffn1. Chess-only today; porting the
   pattern to peano is research-grade work.
4. **Bank-aware memory** - playbook item #10. Cross-cutting; needs an
   IRON-side `Buffer(..., placement=bank_N)` API hook + kernel-side
   address-space-qualified pointer types modeled after `example.h`'s
   `IFM_DM_BANK` / `WT_DM_BANK` / `OFM_DM_BANK` aliases.
5. **Architectural / fifo / placement rebalancing** - intrinsic per-kernel
   costs captured via leave-one-in NOOP_KERNEL_FILES ablation. m6
   lower bound after perfect balance ≈ max(intrinsic) ≈ 4.83 ms
   (= inner_pair_cv1) = 207 fps; m9 lower bound ≈ 2.40 ms
   (= cv2_concat2_streamed) = 417 fps. These dominate post-rebalance
   targets.
6. **Softmax exp2** - replace the scalar fp32 LUT in
   `yolo_m9_attn_score_fused_vec.cc` with hardware
   `aie::exp2<bfloat16>` (see `aie_kernels/aie2p/softmax.cc`).
   Bit-exactness risk; would be tested separately.
7. **Push the peano backend bug fix upstream** for the
   `getCombinedOpcodeUNPACKLoad` crash on
   `accum<acc32, {16,32}>::to_vector<int8>(shift)` following
   `aie::mul/aie::mac`. Unblocks 4 m9 kernels' vec skip-add tails.

**`aie::parallel_lookup` investigation** (deferred). PL on AIE2P peano
compiles + runs correctly (see standalone harness at
`programming_examples/basic/pl_layout_test/`), but `lut<4>` is
fundamentally a linear-approximation API (offset + slope * frac), not
a plain-byte lookup. For yolo's INT8 SiLU LUT use case, effective
throughput is ~equal to or slower than scalar `silu_lut[srs+128]`.
PL becomes interesting again only if SiLU is re-derived as a
piecewise linear approximation.

## Make targets

Run `make help` for the canonical list. Highlights:

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make data` | ONNX → `data/{weights,bias,silu_lut}.bin` + manifest |
| `make BLOCK=mN` | Build per-block xclbin + insts |
| `make BLOCK=mN run_ort` | Build + run + bit-exact compare vs ORT |
| `make BLOCK=mN time` | Build + time (mean/median/min/max ms, fps) |
| `make chain` | Build chain xclbin + insts (defaults to N=1) |
| `make run_chain` | Build + run + bit-exact compare vs ORT (every sample) |
| `make time_chain` | Build + time (latency or per-sample throughput) |
| `make trace` | Build with HW packet trace, run 1 iter, parse summary |
| `make clean` | Wipe `build/` entirely |
| `make clean_chain` | Wipe only the chain xclbin/MLIR (cheap) |

**Environment knobs:**

- `BLOCK=mN` — selects the per-block target (default `m0`).
- `CHAIN_N_SAMPLES=N` — number of samples per chain dispatch. The Makefile
  tracks this in a stamp file and forces the chain MLIR to rebuild
  whenever the value changes, so `run_chain` and `time_chain` always
  match the xclbin's compiled-in `N`.
- `M9_STAGE=N` — for `BLOCK=m9`, selects which staged build of m9 to
  produce (1 = cv1 only, 10 = full PSA block; default 10). Same stamp-
  file rebuild trigger as `CHAIN_N_SAMPLES`. `M9_CHAIN_STAGE` is
  accepted as a legacy alias. Only stages 1 and 10 are wired through
  `test_block_ort.py` (others lack a clean single-tensor ORT analog).
- `TIME_ARGS="--n-warmup 5 --n-iters 100"` — passed through to the timing
  harnesses.
- `TRACE_SIZE_PER_WORKER=N`, `TRACE_EVENTS=A,B,C` — bake AIE2P packet
  tracing into per-block MLIR. The `make trace` target sets these and
  handles the build/run/parse round-trip via `scripts/trace_m8.sh`.

**Note on incremental builds:** the Makefile correctly rebuilds on `.cc`
or `.py` source changes (mtime-tracked). If you edit the `Makefile` itself
(e.g., changing `PEANOWRAP2P_FLAGS`) or change a `TRACE_*` env var,
existing `.o` / `.mlir` files won't pick up the change automatically — run
`make clean` first. `CHAIN_N_SAMPLES` is handled automatically.

## Tracing

`scripts/trace_m8.sh` (via `make trace`) builds the m8 megakernel with
HW packet trace ops, runs one iteration, and parses the trace. Output:

- `build/trace_m8.txt` — raw trace packets (hex)
- `build/trace_m8.json` — parsed events
- stdout — per-tile cycle summary from `python/utils/trace/get_trace_summary.py`

Pick the events you want via `TRACE_EVENTS`:

```bash
# Default (8-event packed set: INSTR_EVENT_0/1 + stalls + vector + ...)
make trace

# Stall attribution — what's the core blocked on?
TRACE_EVENTS=INSTR_EVENT_0,INSTR_EVENT_1,LOCK_STALL,STREAM_STALL,MEMORY_STALL \
    make trace

# Vector activity — what fraction of cycles are vmac?
TRACE_EVENTS=INSTR_EVENT_0,INSTR_EVENT_1,ACTIVE,INSTR_VECTOR \
    make trace

# Larger trace BO (default 32 KB / worker)
TRACE_SIZE_PER_WORKER=65536 make trace
```

Event names come from `aie.utils.trace.events.CoreEventAIE2P`. The
chain-side equivalent uses `aie2_yolo_iron_partial.py`'s `TRACE_BLOCKS`
env to restrict tracing to specific blocks (the AIE2 trace packet-ID
space caps at 31 simultaneously-traced workers, so the full 26-tile chain
needs front-half/back-half splits).

## Design overview

The 11 blocks map to these kernel families:

| Block | Topology | Kernel family | Tiles |
|---|---|---|---:|
| m0 | conv_stride (stem) | `yolo_m0_conv2dk3_silu_bias` (OIYX raw, in_c=3 padded to 8) | 1 |
| m1 | conv_stride | `yolo_conv2dk3_stride2_silu_bias_oiyxi8o8` (shared, runtime shapes) | 1 |
| m3, m5, m7 | conv_stride | `yolo_conv2dk3_stride2_silu_bias_oiyxi8o8_chunked` (per-block, weight-streamed) | 1 each |
| m2, m4 | c3k2_small | `yolo_c3k2_small_{cv1_split, m0_cv1, m0_cv2_skip, cv2_concat3}` | 3 each |
| m6 | c3k2_heavy | `yolo_c3k2_heavy_{m_0_split, inner_pair_cv1, inner_pair_cv2_skip, cv3_concat2}` + `c3k2_small_{cv1_split, cv2_concat3}` | 5 |
| **m8** | **c3k2_heavy 2-tile megakernel** | `yolo_m8_front_cv1_split_fused` + `yolo_m8_back_cv3_cv2_fused` + `yolo_c3k2_heavy_inner_pair_{cv1,cv2_skip}_streamed` | **2** |
| m9 | PSA (attention + FFN) | 12 kernels: `yolo_m9_{cv1_split, qkv, qkv_pack, qk_pack, attn_score_fused, v_pack, sv_row, pe_add_row, proj_skip_row, ffn_0_silu_row, ffn_1_skip_row, cv2_concat2_streamed}` (qk_row + attn_scale + softmax_row collapsed into `attn_score_fused_vec.cc`; sv_row + sv_row_acc share the same `.o` with two extern C entries) | 7 |
| m10 | head | `yolo_m10_{conv2dk1_silu_xy_pool, linear_gemm, softmax}` (fused onto 1 tile) | 1 |

Total: **26 of 32** compute tiles used.

### m8 — 2-tile megakernel

The most compute-dense block. Implementation lives in
[`scripts/m8_megakernel_2tile.py`](scripts/m8_megakernel_2tile.py).

Two compute tiles, each running a single Worker that fuses three c3k2_heavy
sub-operations into one C kernel call per chunk:

- **Tile A (5,3)** — `k_m8_front` (cv1 + m_0_split) + `k_pair_cv1` + `k_pair_cv2` for pair0
- **Tile B (5,4)** — `k_pair_cv1` + `k_pair_cv2` for pair1 + `k_m8_back` (cv3 + cv2)

Cross-tile data lives in shared L1 ObjectFifos (no DMA hop). Weights for
the big convs (cv1, cv2, pair0, pair1) are streamed from memtiles via
`StaticWeightStream`; the small m_0_split and cv3 weights are static on
the compute tiles. Tile A reads ws_pair1's recv buffer via west-neighbor
shared L1 from (4,4).

### m9 — staged PSA

[`scripts/m9_stage.py`](scripts/m9_stage.py) implements the PSA block
across 5 compute tiles + 2 memtiles in 10 stages (each stage adds one
attention sub-kernel). The chain uses stage 10 = full m9. Lower stages
exist for chain-bisect debugging via `M9_CHAIN_STAGE=N`.

### Kernel symbol mangling

Several blocks share a kernel template (e.g. c3k2_small for m2/m4,
c3k2_heavy for m6, chunked conv_stride for m3/m5/m7) but with different
runtime shapes / weight sizes. To let them coexist in one MLIR module the
Makefile compiles each block's variant with `-DKERNEL_SUFFIX=_mN`, which
suffixes every exported symbol — so `yolo_c3k2_small_cv1_split_vec.cc`
produces `..._m2.o` and `..._m4.o` with non-colliding `func.func` names.
The IRON builder passes the matching suffixed name into `Kernel(...)`.

### Kernel design notes (chunked stride-2 conv)

The shared
[`yolo_conv2dk3_stride2_silu_bias_oiyxi8o8_chunked_vec.cc`](kernels/yolo_conv2dk3_stride2_silu_bias_oiyxi8o8_chunked_vec.cc)
that backs m3/m5/m7 demonstrates several patterns worth carrying to other
peano-compiled AIE2P kernels in this repo:

**Compile-time shape specialization.** The kernel requires
`-DYOLO_IN_W=… -DYOLO_IN_C=… -DYOLO_OUT_C=… -DYOLO_INTERIOR_MODE=…` per
block (set in the Makefile's `CHUNKED_SHAPE_$(blk)` lookup). These become
`constexpr int` constants at file scope; the runtime ABI args are kept
in the C signature but the function body reads the constexprs. This is
the single biggest perf lever (typically 1.5-3× on top of vector loops)
because peano can:
- fold address math (`* in_c`, `* out_c`, `* (ic_tiles*kH*kW*64)`) into
  shifts and immediates, eliminating runtime scalar muls,
- dead-strip the unused `if constexpr (...)` branch (in this kernel:
  the unused `INTERIOR_MODE` variant), and
- emit tighter pipelined loops with known trip counts.

**`AIE_LOOP_RANGE` everywhere.** Peano needs `[[clang::loop_min/max_iteration_count]]`
to pipeline (and unroll) loops with runtime-derived bounds. Wrap each
non-fully-unrolled loop with `AIE_LOOP_RANGE(min, max)`; use
`AIE_LOOP_UNROLL_FULL` on small fixed-bound loops (e.g. `kx` over 3).
Note that `AIE_PREPARE_FOR_PIPELINING` is a no-op under peano (it only
lowers for chess) — see `aie_kernels/aie_kernel_utils.h`.

**3-way split for edge vs interior.** The bounds-check branch needed for
left/right border columns blocks software pipelining if it sits inside
the hot loop. Splitting the `x_tile` loop into left-edge / interior /
right-edge nests (with the edges' bodies *inlined*, not factored into
lambdas — peano doesn't reliably inline them) lets the interior become
fully straight-line vector ops.

**OC×2 and 2X×2OC accumulator fold.** The mmul-throughput-hiding pattern
from `example.h`: carry multiple accumulators so each weight load is
reused across multiple X positions and each input gather is reused across
multiple OC banks. `YOLO_INTERIOR_MODE=2` (4 accs: 2 X × 2 OC) for blocks
with enough x_tiles to amortize the pair setup (m3, m5); `MODE=1` (2 accs:
single-X × 2 OC) for small-x_tiles blocks (m7) where the pair setup
overhead would dominate.

**64-bit word-copy gather instead of scalar byte loop.** The 4×8-byte
input gather for one mmul is built via 4 aligned `uint64_t` reads into a
stack `a_buf`, then a single `aie::load_v<32>`. Peano hoists this into
register-to-register `vpush.hi.64` in the steady-state pipelined inner
loop, eliminating the stack round-trip in the hot path.

### Bit-exactness

The integration test of record is `test_chain_ort.py`: same seeded RGB
input fed to both (a) the NPU chain xclbin and (b) ONNX Runtime on the
XINT8 ONNX, with hard element-wise INT8 equality on the final softmax
probs. For `CHAIN_N_SAMPLES=N>1`, every output slice is compared
independently — all N samples must match the single reference.

The conv_stride and c3k2 blocks (m0..m8) each pass `test_block_ort.py
--block mN` bit-exact standalone (see the `run_ort` target). m9 (PSA)
is supported in two stages: `M9_STAGE=1 make BLOCK=m9 run_ort` compares
NPU vs ORT for `/model.9/cv1/act` (cv1 only); `M9_STAGE=10 make BLOCK=m9
run_ort` (default) compares for `/model.9/cv2/act` (full m9). Other m9
stages and m10 (head) aren't supported standalone — covered by the
end-to-end chain test.

[`run_strix_makefile.lit`](run_strix_makefile.lit) exercises both paths
on NPU2 hardware.

## The int8 recipe

Three stages: train float, quantize to int8, materialize per-block
kernel inputs.

### 1. Train (upstream)

YOLO26n-cls is a 1.5M-parameter classifier from Ultralytics. The FP32
checkpoint shipped here (`models/phase1_25k_acc0.9424.pt`, 90.0% test /
94.2% val accuracy on a person/no-person dataset) is the source. See
[`notebooks/yoloexploration.ipynb`](notebooks/yoloexploration.ipynb) for
loading, inference, and COCO validation.

### 2. Quantize (Quark XINT8 PTQ)

[`notebooks/quark_quantization.ipynb`](notebooks/quark_quantization.ipynb)
walks through:

1. Export FP32 PyTorch → FP32 ONNX at fixed `(batch=4, 3, 512, 512)` (Ryzen
   AI requires static shapes).
2. Sanity-check FP32 ONNX vs the PyTorch baseline — catches preprocessing
   bugs before quantization muddies the signal.
3. Build an `onnxruntime.quantization.CalibrationDataReader` from 500
   in-distribution images.
4. Run Quark static PTQ with the **XINT8** spec for both activations and
   weights, **AdaRound** for weight rounding refinement, and **exclude the
   final Softmax** from quantization (empirically: quantizing the final
   Softmax causes a sign-flip that drops accuracy to ~44%; keeping it
   FP32 recovers 89.5%).
5. Evaluate the XINT8 ONNX on the held-out test set, compare to FP32.

Output: `phase1_25k_xint8_acc0.8968.onnx` (1.7 MB, 89.68% test
accuracy, ~0.3 pp from FP32 — within typical static-PTQ overhead). Shipped
under [`models/`](models) and consumed by `gen_yolo_data.py` /
`gen_yolo_silu_luts.py`.

### 3. Extract per-block kernel inputs

[`gen_yolo_data.py`](gen_yolo_data.py) walks the Quark XINT8 ONNX and, for
every Conv / MatMul / Gemm node, emits:

- INT8 weight bins, reordered from ONNX `OIYX` to the `OIYXI8O8` layout
  the AIE2P kernels expect (m0 keeps `OIYX` because `in_c=3` is not
  8-aligned and gets host-side padded to 8 instead).
- INT32 bias bins, promoted from INT8 by `bias_pre_shift` so the runtime
  kernel can use them as the accumulator init when `weight_index == 0`
  (folds the bias-add into the conv's first MAC — no separate bias stage).
- A per-op `right_shift = log2(scale_in) + log2(scale_w) − log2(scale_out)`
  for the int32→int8 banker-rounded requant epilogue.
- `data/manifest.json` indexing it all by layer name.

[`gen_yolo_silu_luts.py`](gen_yolo_silu_luts.py) handles the SiLU
non-linearity: the Quark XINT8 graph encodes SiLU as
`Conv → QL → DQ → HardSigmoid → Mul(const) → QL → DQ → Mul(linear) → QL`.
Per Conv we extract the three QuantizeLinear scales + HardSigmoid params
+ constant multiplier, then sample the closed-form HardSiLU over all 256
INT8 inputs to build a 256-byte LUT (`data/model.N/.../silu_lut.bin`).
At runtime each kernel's epilogue is one LUT lookup:
`out_i8 = silu_lut[clamp(banker_srs(acc, rs)) + 128]`.

## Contributing & debugging

### Where to start if you're new

1. **Run something on HW first.** `make BLOCK=m6 run_ort` is the simplest
   end-to-end (small block, vectorized, bit-exact passes in under a minute).
   If that works, your environment is set up.
2. **Read `placement.py`** — the header lists the per-block tile budget,
   and the **"DESIGN RULES"** comment block (lines 33–~150) captures the
   hard-won lessons (deadlock patterns, via_DMA gotchas, kernel-arg
   stride bugs, etc.). Worth reading once cover-to-cover.
3. **Run `python3 tile_layout.py`** for an ASCII map of the 32 compute
   tiles + which block sits where.
4. **Pick a per-block builder in `aie2_yolo_per_block.py`** and read its
   preceding block-comment header — those describe each block's
   architecture, fan-out, and kernel inventory.

### Adding an optimization to an existing block

1. **Baseline.** `make BLOCK=mN time TIME_ARGS="--n-warmup 5 --n-iters 100"`
   and write down the median ms.
2. **Bit-exact gate.** `make BLOCK=mN run_ort` must pass after every
   step (m9/m10 only via `make run_chain`).
3. **Trace if needed.** `make trace` builds the m8 megakernel with HW
   packet trace ops and prints the per-tile cycle summary. For other
   blocks, copy `scripts/trace_m8.sh` and adapt; the per-block trace
   plumbing in `aie2_yolo_per_block.py` already honors
   `TRACE_SIZE_PER_WORKER` and `TRACE_EVENTS`.
4. **Iterate.** `make clean` is rarely needed for `.cc`/`.py` edits;
   Make's mtime tracking is correct for those. Run `make clean` if you
   edit the Makefile itself or change a `TRACE_*` env var.

### Adding a new kernel

1. Drop a `_vec.cc` under `kernels/` (vectorized AIE2P API style — see
   `yolo_m8_back_cv3_cv2_fused_vec.cc` for a non-trivial example with
   chunked-OC, fused requant, SiLU LUT, and skip-add).
2. Wire a build rule in the **kernel build rules** section of the
   Makefile (search for "c3k2_heavy streamed inner-pair kernels" for the
   `$(foreach blk, ... $(eval ...))` pattern). Add the `.o` to
   `KERNEL_OBJS`.
3. Declare it as a `Kernel(...)` in the relevant builder
   (`aie2_yolo_per_block.py` or one of `scripts/*.py`) with arg types
   matching the C signature exactly.
4. Call it from a `Worker` body. Pass `aie::int8_t*` args as IRON
   `B._i8(shape)` types; scalar ints as `np.int32` (or `np.uint32` if
   the kernel wants to divide / shift on them — see below).

### Block ablation (bottleneck attribution)

When the chain is slower than the per-block sum suggests it should be (or
faster — both happen in pipelined chains), per-block standalone timing
can mislead. Use the `NOOP_BLOCK` Make env var to compile any subset of
blocks' kernels with `-DNOOP_KERNEL`. Their `extern "C"` entries
early-return, so the chain's DMA / lock / placement pattern is unchanged
but those blocks contribute ~0 ms of compute. Output is garbage —
bit-exactness fails by design; the signal is chain wall-clock.

```bash
# Ablation: how much does m9 contribute to the chain?
rm -f build/yolo_m9_*.o && make clean_chain
CHAIN_N_SAMPLES=15 NOOP_BLOCK=m9 make time_chain
# Historical (pre-m9-1x1-vec arc): 317 ms baseline → 57 ms noop'd ⇒ m9 = 260 ms / 82%
# Today (post-cv2 vec):              75 ms baseline → ? ms noop'd  ⇒ rerun to attribute the new remainder

# Combine: noop multiple blocks (space-separated, quoted)
rm -f build/yolo_m9_*.o build/yolo_m10_*.o && make clean_chain
CHAIN_N_SAMPLES=15 NOOP_BLOCK="m9 m10" make time_chain
```

Notes:

- All 11 blocks (m0..m10) are supported.
- The `-DNOOP_KERNEL` flag only affects compile of that block's kernel
  `.o` files. Make won't rebuild a `.o` when only `NOOP_BLOCK` changes
  (mtime tracking misses it), so manually `rm` the affected `.o` plus
  `make clean_chain` between runs. For unsure cases, just `make clean`.
- The harness adds zero overhead when `NOOP_BLOCK` is unset — the
  `#ifdef NOOP_KERNEL return;` guards compile out completely.
- Output garbage from noop'd blocks doesn't break the chain — downstream
  blocks just consume junk inputs. Chain DMA scheduling is unaffected.

**Finer-grained per-kernel ablation inside a c3k2 block** — when
NOOP_BLOCK shows a c3k2_small / c3k2_heavy block as the bottleneck,
pass `NOOP_KERNEL_FILES="<obj-stem> ..."` to noop only specific
kernels within it. Useful for picking which tile to deep-opt first
without rebuilding the whole block:

```bash
# Standalone ablation: which tile in m2 dominates?
rm -f build/yolo_c3k2_small_*_m2.o build/final_m2.xclbin build/insts_m2.bin
NOOP_KERNEL_FILES="yolo_c3k2_small_cv2_concat3_m2" make BLOCK=m2 time
# m2 baseline 27.75 ms → noop'd 18.70 ms ⇒ cv2_concat3 = 9.05 ms

# Multiple kernels (space-separated, quoted)
rm -f build/yolo_c3k2_small_*_m2.o build/final_m2.xclbin build/insts_m2.bin
NOOP_KERNEL_FILES="yolo_c3k2_small_m0_cv1_m2 yolo_c3k2_small_m0_cv2_skip_m2" \
  make BLOCK=m2 time
```

This is how the m2 deep-opt arc found cv2_concat3 as the first bottleneck
(9 ms), then m0_cv2_skip after the cv2 vec epilogue (7 ms surfaced post-cv2),
then cv1_split (4.5 ms surfaced post-m0_cv2_skip). Per-kernel attribution
between c3k2 sub-kernels is wired into the eval rules for
`yolo_c3k2_small_{cv1_split,m0_cv1,m0_cv2_skip,cv2_concat3}_{m2,m4,m6}.o`.

This is how the m9-is-the-bottleneck finding was discovered: the
optimization arc that took m3/m5/m7 from 186 ms → 19 ms standalone moved
the chain by only ~14 ms, and ablating each block individually (m0
alone, m1 alone, the 6 conv_stride blocks together) showed each
contributed <1 ms. Only m9 ablation moved the chain meaningfully. The
same harness then surfaced cv2 as the m9 critical-path kernel during
the m9 1×1 vec arc.

### Common debugging patterns

- **Build hangs, no error**: check the build log for **L1 overflow**
  warnings (e.g. `Failed to allocate buffer "X" with size: NNNN bytes`,
  `Bank-aware allocation failed`). The xclbin may still build but you
  used too much L1; reduce per-tile buffer depth or stream weights from
  the memtile via `StaticWeightStream`.
- **Bit-exact failure with a partial set of mismatches**: usually a
  kernel signature mismatch (IRON Kernel arg types vs C function args),
  or a stride mistake in a memref index. The kernel signature must match
  positionally — IRON doesn't type-check across the C boundary.
- **`make` builds something stale**: if you've edited the Makefile or
  changed a `TRACE_*` env var, run `make clean`. `CHAIN_N_SAMPLES`
  changes are handled automatically by a stamp file.
- **Runtime timeout (`ERT_CMD_STATE_TIMEOUT`)**: a deadlock. Likely
  causes — see `placement.py` DESIGN RULES section. Most common is a
  cons-side `acquire(N)` with N>1 emitting an `AcquireGE,N` that blocks
  the chain ahead of it. Smallest acquire first, or bump fifo depths.
- **`__divsi3` in a kernel `.o`** (visible via `llvm-readobj -r build/foo.o`):
  Peano can't prove signed-int division by a power of 2 is shift-eligible.
  Cast the dividend to `(uint32_t)` and the divisor to `Nu` — `/8`
  becomes `>> 3`. (Cleanup-only, not a major perf lever.)
- **Looking at the compiled `.o` directly**: `llvm-objdump -d build/foo.o`
  to see instructions; `grep -E '\bv[a-z]+\b'` for vector ops; the
  presence of `vmac`, `vldb`, `vmov` means you got vectorization. If
  the kernel was supposed to vectorize and only has scalar `mac/mov/add`,
  check the surrounding loop for branches that might be inhibiting the
  vectorizer.

### Adding a new block builder

1. Add a `_build_mN(...)` function in `aie2_yolo_per_block.py` following
   the pattern of an existing block of similar topology (conv_stride →
   `_build_conv_stride_block`, c3k2 → `_build_c3k2_small/heavy`,
   attention → `_build_psa` or the staged variant in `scripts/m9_stage.py`).
2. Register it in the `_BUILDERS` dict near the bottom of
   `aie2_yolo_per_block.py`.
3. Add the block to `yolo_spec.NETWORK` so the layer shapes / kernel
   parameter inference works.
4. Add a `PLACEMENT[block_name]` entry (or delegate to a staged builder
   that hardcodes its own coords, like `m8_megakernel_2tile.py`).

## Known limitations and follow-ups

- **PSA m9 multi-sample**: end-to-end multi-sample dispatch already
  works via `CHAIN_N_SAMPLES=N` (HW BD-chain replays the per-sample
  transfer N times in one XRT call). What's *not* done: pushing the batch
  dimension into the PSA m9 kernel signatures so the attention matmuls
  compute on `(B, nh, S, d)` natively instead of N sequential
  `(nh, S, d)` tensors. Whether it would pay off depends on the current
  per-sample breakdown — m9 isn't the top contributor today.
- **Trace flow tile cap**: AIE2 trace packet IDs cap simultaneously-
  traced workers at 31 — the full chain (26 compute tiles) fits, but
  larger designs may need front-half / back-half traces (the
  `TRACE_BLOCKS=m0,m1,...` env in `aie2_yolo_iron_partial.py` handles
  this).
- **m8 megakernel scalar skip-row copy**: the worker body has a small
  IRON-emitted `for x: for kk: sk_r[x,0,kk] = sa_mid[x,0,kk]` to forward
  one row from split_a to pair0_skip (and same for pair1). The cost is
  small relative to the conv but folding it into `k_pair_cv1` as a second
  vectorized output would be cleaner. See the TODO in
  `scripts/m8_megakernel_2tile.py:_do_p0c1`.
