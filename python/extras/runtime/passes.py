        This pass performs fusion of loop nests using a slicing-based approach. The
        transformation works on an MLIR `Block` granularity and applies to all
        blocks of the pass is run on. It combines two fusion strategies:
        producer-consumer fusion and sibling fusion. Producer-consumer fusion is
        aimed at fusing pairs of loops where the first one writes to a memref that
        the second reads. Sibling fusion targets pairs of loops that share no
        dependences between them but that load from the same memref. The fused loop
        nests, when possible, are rewritten to access significantly smaller local
        buffers instead of the original memref's, and the latter are often either
        completely optimized away or contracted. This transformation leads to
        enhanced locality and lower memory footprint through the elimination or
        contraction of temporaries/intermediate memref's. These benefits are
        sometimes achieved at the expense of redundant computation through a cost
        model that evaluates available choices such as the depth at which a source
        slice should be materialized in the designation slice.

        will be legal in the LLVM backend. It does this at the memref level, so this
        pass must be applied before lowering all the way to LLVM.

        This pass currently addresses two issues.

        #### Loading and storing predicate types

        It is only legal to load/store predicate types equal to (or greater than) a
        full predicate register, which in MLIR is `vector<[16]xi1>`. Smaller
        predicate types (`vector<[1|2|4|8]xi1>`) must be converted to/from a full
        predicate type (referred to as a `svbool`) before and after storing and
        loading respectively. This pass does this by widening allocations and
        inserting conversion intrinsics. Note: Non-powers-of-two masks (e.g.
        `vector<[7]xi1>`), which are not SVE predicates, are ignored.

        For example:

        ```mlir
        %alloca = memref.alloca() : memref<vector<[4]xi1>>
        %mask = vector.constant_mask [4] : vector<[4]xi1>
        memref.store %mask, %alloca[] : memref<vector<[4]xi1>>
        %reload = memref.load %alloca[] : memref<vector<[4]xi1>>
        ```
        Becomes:
        ```mlir
        %alloca = memref.alloca() {alignment = 1 : i64} : memref<vector<[16]xi1>>
        %mask = vector.constant_mask [4] : vector<[4]xi1>
        %svbool = arm_sve.convert_to_svbool %mask : vector<[4]xi1>
        memref.store %svbool, %alloca[] : memref<vector<[16]xi1>>
        %reload_svbool = memref.load %alloca[] : memref<vector<[16]xi1>>
        %reload = arm_sve.convert_from_svbool %reload_svbool : vector<[4]xi1>
        ```

        #### Relax alignments for SVE vector allocas

        The storage for SVE vector types only needs to have an alignment that
        matches the element type (for example 4 byte alignment for `f32`s). However,
        the LLVM backend currently defaults to aligning to `base size` x
        `element size` bytes. For non-legal vector types like `vector<[8]xf32>` this
        results in 8 x 4 = 32-byte alignment, but the backend only supports up to
        16-byte alignment for SVE vectors on the stack. Explicitly setting a smaller
        alignment prevents this issue.

        """One-Shot Bufferize

        This pass bufferizes all ops that implement `BufferizableOpInterface`. It
        first performs an inplacability analysis on SSA use-def chains of tensor
        values to determine which OpOperands may bufferize in-place, i.e., without
        inserting a buffer copy. It then rewrites the IR, inserting a buffer
        allocation and copy for each OpOperand that was decided to bufferize
        out-of-place.

        One-Shot Bufferize (and `BufferizableOpInterface`) was designed for ops that
        are in destination-passing style. When bufferizing such ops, it is possible
        to reuse the buffer of a tensor OpOperand for a tensor OpResult. In essence,
        a possible destination of an operation is already passed as an SSA value.

        `tensor.insert` is an example for an op in destination-passing style. E.g.,
        when bufferizing `%t0 = tensor.insert %f into %dest[%idx]`, `buffer(%t0)` is
        identical to `buffer(%dest)` in the absence of RaW conflicts. As a counter
        example, `tensor.generate` is not in destination-passing style and always
        results in a new buffer allocation.

        One-Shot Bufferize does not deallocate any buffers that it allocates. The
        `-buffer-deallocation` pass should be run after One-Shot Bufferize to insert
        the deallocation operations necessary to eliminate memory leaks.

        One-Shot Bufferize will by default reject IR that contains non-bufferizable
        op, i.e., ops that do not implemement BufferizableOpInterface. Such IR can
        be allowed with `allow-unknown-ops=1`. In that case, to_memref and to_tensor
        ops will be generated at the bufferization boundary. This is useful for
        compatibility with existing partial bufferization passes: These can
        bufferize the remaining IR after running One-Shot Bufferize.

        Note: Running One-Shot Bufferize after a partial bufferization pass is
        currently not supported. Running partial bufferization passes after running
        One-Shot Bufferize is supported and the recommended way to gradually
        migrate from partial bufferization to One-Shot Bufferize.

        With `dialect-filter`, bufferization can be restricted to a set of dialects.
        If no filter is specified, all ops that implement `BufferizableOpInterface`
        are bufferized. Ops from the `std` dialect are an exception: These ops are
        always ignored, even if no filter is specified. When specifying a dialect
        filter and `allow-unknown-ops` is not turned on, bufferization would fail
        when encountering an op that is not included in the filter (even if it is
        bufferizable).

        One-Shot Bufferize will by default assume memref types with fully dynamic
        layout maps when a precise layout cannot be inferred. E.g., this is the case
        when wrapping a non-bufferizable op in to_memref/to_tensor ops. This
        behavior can be overridden with `unknown-type-conversion`. Valid values are
        `fully-dynamic-layout-map` and `identity-layout-map`.

        For testing/debugging purposes, `test-analysis-only=1 print-conflicts=1`
        prints analysis results and explains why an OpOperand was decided to
        bufferize out-of-place. This is useful for understanding why One-Shot
        Bufferize chose to insert a certain buffer copy.

        `bufferize-function-boundaries` is an experimental flag for bufferizing
        `FuncOp`, `ReturnOp` and `CallOp`. This feature is still under development
        and supports only simple cases at the moment. In particular:

        * Recursive or circular function call graphs are not supported.
        * External functions (without bodies) that return a tensor are not
          supported.
        * Function with multiple blocks or multiple ReturnOps are not supported.
        * Layout maps on function signatures can be controlled with a separate
          `function-boundary-type-conversion` option, which is similar to
          `unknown-type-conversion` but supports an additional `infer-layout-map`
          option. `fully-dynamic-layout-map` and `identity-layout-map` ensure that
          function signatures bufferize to easily predictable types, potentially at
          the cost of additional casts and copies, respectively. When layout maps
          are inferred, function return types may be more precise, but less
          predictable. Function argument types cannot be inferred and always have
          fully dynamic layout maps with `infer-layout-map`.

        One-Shot Bufferize implements the following contract around function calls:
        The buffer of function arguments is always writable (unless annotated with
        `bufferization.writable = false`). A buffer copy may be inserted at the call
        site where necessary. Alias sets and equivalence info is propagated through
        function calls. Whenever a function is bufferized, all other functions that
        are being called were already analyzed and bufferized, so exact alias and
        equivalence information is available. This is why recursive function calls
        are not yet supported.

        One-Shot Bufferize gathers additional information during the analysis phase
        when function boundary bufferization is activated. E.g., whether a function
        argument is read/written and which returned values are aliasing/equivalent.
        For debugging purposes, such information can be printed with
        `test-analysis-only`.

        shape reification, and each single dynamic shape is denoted by shape.with_shape.

        There're two main reasons this shape-outline pass is needed:
        1. Many passes don't take shape reification part into consideration.
           Therefore we need to "remove" the shape reification part temporarily for
           these passes.
        2. Sometimes we cannot redo shape reification after converting from dialect
           A to dialect B. Because op-level shape reification is only implemented
           on A.

        """Adds all required dealloc operations for all allocations in the input program

        This pass implements an algorithm to automatically introduce all required
        deallocation operations for all buffers in the input program. This ensures
        that the resulting program does not have any memory leaks.

        The Buffer Deallocation pass operates on the level of operations
        implementing the FunctionOpInterface. Such operations can take MemRefs as
        arguments, but also return them. To ensure compatibility among all functions
        (including external ones), some rules have to be enforced. They are just
        assumed to hold for all external functions. Functions for which the
        definition is available ideally also already adhere to the ABI.
        Otherwise, all MemRef write operations in the input IR must dominate all
        MemRef read operations in the input IR. Then, the pass may modify the input
        IR by inserting `bufferization.clone` operations such that the output IR
        adheres to the function boundary ABI:
        * When a MemRef is passed as a function argument, ownership is never
          acquired. It is always the caller's responsibility to deallocate such
          MemRefs.
        * Returning a MemRef from a function always passes ownership to the caller,
          i.e., it is also the caller's responsibility to deallocate MemRefs
          returned from a called function.
        * A function must not return a MemRef with the same allocated base buffer as
          one of its arguments (in this case a copy has to be created). Note that in
          this context two subviews of the same buffer that don't overlap are also
          considered an alias.

        It is recommended to bufferize all operations first such that no tensor
        values remain in the IR once this pass is applied. That way all allocated
        MemRefs will be properly deallocated without any additional manual work.
        Otherwise, the pass that bufferizes the remaining tensors is responsible to
        add the corresponding deallocation operations. Note that this pass does not
        consider any values of tensor type and assumes that MemRef values defined by
        `bufferization.to_memref` do not return ownership and do not have to be
        deallocated. `bufferization.to_tensor` operations are handled similarly to
        `bufferization.clone` operations with the exception that the result value is
        not handled because it's a tensor (not a MemRef).

        The `private-function-dynamic-ownership` pass option allows the pass to add
        additional arguments to private functions to dynamically give ownership of
        MemRefs to callees. This can enable earlier deallocations and allows the
        pass to by-pass the function boundary ABI and thus potentially leading to
        fewer MemRef clones being inserted. For example, the private function
        ```mlir
        func.func private @passthrough(%memref: memref<2xi32>) -> memref<2xi32> {
          return %memref : memref<2xi32>
        }
        ```
        would be converted to
        ```mlir
        func.func private @passthrough(%memref: memref<2xi32>,
                                       %ownership: i1) -> (memref<2xi32>, i1) {
          return %memref, %ownership : memref<2xi32>, i1
        }
        ```
        and thus allows the returned MemRef to alias with the MemRef passed as
        argument (which would otherwise be forbidden according to the function
        boundary ABI).

        The goal of this pass is optimization (reducing runtime) by removing
        unnecessary instructions. Unlike other passes that rely on local information
        gathered from patterns to accomplish optimization, this pass uses a full
        analysis of the IR, specifically, liveness analysis, and is thus more
        powerful.

        Currently, this pass performs the following optimizations:
        (A) Removes function arguments that are not live,
        (B) Removes function return values that are not live across all callers of
        the function,
        (C) Removes unneccesary operands, results, region arguments, and region
        terminator operands of region branch ops, and,
        (D) Removes simple and region branch ops that have all non-live results and
        don't affect memory in any way,

        iff

        the IR doesn't have any non-function symbol ops, non-call symbol user ops
        and branch ops.

        Here, a "simple op" refers to an op that isn't a symbol op, symbol-user op,
        region branch op, branch op, region branch terminator op, or return-like.

        It is noteworthy that we do not refer to non-live values as "dead" in this
        file to avoid confusing it with dead code analysis's "dead", which refers to
        unreachable code (code that never executes on hardware) while "non-live"
        refers to code that executes on hardware but is unnecessary. Thus, while the
        removal of dead code helps little in reducing runtime, removing non-live
        values should theoretically have significant impact (depending on the amount
        removed).

        It is also important to note that unlike other passes (like `canonicalize`)
        that apply op-specific optimizations through patterns, this pass uses
        different interfaces to handle various types of ops and tries to cover all
        existing ops through these interfaces.

        It is because of its reliance on (a) liveness analysis and (b) interfaces
        that makes it so powerful that it can optimize ops that don't have a
        canonicalizer and even when an op does have a canonicalizer, it can perform
        more aggressive optimizations, as observed in the test files associated with
        this pass.

        Example of optimization (A):-

        ```
        int add_2_to_y(int x, int y) {
          return 2 + y
        }

        print(add_2_to_y(3, 4))
        print(add_2_to_y(5, 6))
        ```

        becomes

        ```
        int add_2_to_y(int y) {
          return 2 + y
        }

        print(add_2_to_y(4))
        print(add_2_to_y(6))
        ```

        Example of optimization (B):-

        ```
        int, int get_incremented_values(int y) {
          store y somewhere in memory
          return y + 1, y + 2
        }

        y1, y2 = get_incremented_values(4)
        y3, y4 = get_incremented_values(6)
        print(y2)
        ```

        int get_incremented_values(int y) {

        y4 = get_incremented_values(6)

        It is interesting to see that `%result2` won't be removed even though it is
        not live because `%terminator_operand3` forwards to it and cannot be
        removed. And, that is because it also forwards to `%arg4`, which is live.

        ```

          square = y ^ 2
          double = y * 2

        sq, do = square_and_double_of_y(5)

        and warns if a transform IR value may be used by an operation after it was
        "freed" by some other operation, as described by side effects on the
        `TransformMappingResource`. This statically detects situations that lead to
        errors when interpreting the Transform IR.

        The pass is capable of handling branching control flow and reports all
        _potential_ use-after-free situations, e.g., a may-use-after-free is
        reported if at least one of the control flow paths between the definition of
        a value and its use contains an operation with a "free" effect on the
        `TransformMappingResource`. It does not currently perform an SCCP-style data
        flow analysis to prove that some branches are not taken, however, SCCP and
        other control flow simplifications can be performed on the transform IR
        prior to this pass provided that transform ops implement the relevant
        control flow interfaces.
