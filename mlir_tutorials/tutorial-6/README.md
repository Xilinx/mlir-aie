# <ins>Tutorial 6 - Communication (packet routing)</ins>

We already looked at how we can use stream switches and tile DMAs to communicate data between tiles that are non-adjacent/ far apart in [tutorial-4](../tutorial-4). There we discussed how routes in a switchbox can be configured in circuit switch mode or packet switch mode and showed examples of circuit switch mode routing. Packet switch mode is another communication format and will will examine it more closely in this tutorial.

## <ins>Packets</ins>
Packets are central to packet-switched routing and provide the ultimate flexibility for run-time data steering. A DMA transfer is converted into a data packet with a prepended packet header and a signal marker for the end of packet. It is then forwarded from switchbox to switchbox along routes much like a circuit switched flow. The difference is that each switchbox along the flow can be configured to know where packets with a predefined packet ID is supposed to go and can forward packets, drop packets or strip the header from packets (such as when the packet reaches its final destination).

## <ins>Packet Flow</ins>
To convert a circuit switched flow into a packet switched one, we need to do two things:

(1) Use the packet switched logical flow operator `AIE.packet_flow` instead of the circuit switched flow operator `AIE.flow`

(2) Configure the source tile DMA to encapsulate the buffer data into packets using the `AIE.dma_bd_packet` operation

The packet switched flow operator is declared much like the circuit switched flow operator with the following syntax:
```
AIE.packet_flow($packet_id) {
    AIE.packet_source<$tile, $bundle : $channel>
    AIE.packet_dest<$tile, $bundle : $channel>
}
```
An example of this is:
```
AIE.packet_flow(0xD) {
    AIE.packet_source<%tiler14, DMA : 0>
    AIE.packet_dest<%tile34, DMA : 1>
}
```
`$packet_id`: 5-bit unsigned packet ID. This flow is configured to pass packets with that packet id

Much like in `AIE.flow`, the %tile, %bundle and %channel represent valid endpoints specific to the architecture.

Valid bundle names and channels are listed below: 
| Bundle | Channels (In) | Channels (Out) |
|-------|---|---|
| DMA   | 2 | 2 |
| Core  | 2 | 2 |
| West  | 4 | 4 |
| East  | 4 | 4 |
| North | 4 | 6 |
| South | 6 | 4 |
| Trace | 1 | 0 |

> Note that be default, packet flows with a DMA destination will configure the destination tile switchbox to strip off the packet header.

## <ins>Tile DMA packet config</ins>

Tile DMA can be configured so that buffer data is packetized through the use of the `AIE.dma_bd_packet` operation as shown below:
```
AIE.dma_bd_packet($packet_type, $packet_id)
```
An example of this inside a BD definition would be:
```
    ^bd0:
        AIE.use_lock(%lock14_6, Acquire, 1)
        AIE.dma_bd_packet(0x4, 0xD) 
        aie.dma_bd(%buf14 : memref<256xi32>) { offset = 0 : i32, len = 256 : i32 }
        AIE.use_lock(%lock14_6, Release, 0)
        cf.br ^end
```
| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
|`$packet_type`| Arbitrary 3-bit value that is used to identify source packet types. These can be used to indicate that packets from the same source to the same destination might belong to different sets. The switches do no use these values but the other components can if they process the packet headers. For general packet routing, these can be left to the default. |
|`$packet_id`| Arbitrary 5-bit value used to identify packet routes. Switchboxes match the packet id to determine if packets should follow the switchbox route rules or if the packet should be dropped|

The configuration parameters that needs to match in order for packets to be successfully routed along a flow is the packet ID, which is specified in (1) the tile DMA BD config and (2) the packet switched flow. As as these match, the packetized data will be communicated along the flow path the same as in the circuit switch case.

The next logical question then is what benefit does packet switch mode offer then if it functions the same as circuit switch mode. And the answer is that we can actually share the same physical flow resources (switchbox streams) with multiple packet flows such that data is shared over time on the same physical stream. We will explore that in more detail in [tutorial-7](../tutorial-7).


## <ins>Tutorial 6 Lab </ins>

1. Read through the [aie.mlir](aie.mlir) design. What is the packet ID used in this example? <img src="../images/answer1.jpg" title="0xD" height=25>

2. Measure the latency of the data transfer in packet mode and compare it to the circuit switch mode result from [tutorial-4](../tutorial-4). How does it compare? <img src="../images/answer1.jpg" title="???" height=25>
