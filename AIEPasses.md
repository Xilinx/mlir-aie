### `-aie-assign-bd-ids`

_Assign bd ids to aie.dma_bd ops._

### `-aie-assign-buffer-addresses`

_Assign memory locations for buffers in each tile_

Buffers in a tile generally have an address that does not significantly
matter in the design.  Hence, most of the time we can instantiate
aie.buffer operations without an address.  This pass determines
updates each aie.buffer operation without an address to have a
well-defined address.  This enables later passes to have a
consistent view of the memory map of a system.

#### Options

```
-alloc-scheme : Select allocation scheme: basic-sequential or bank-aware. Default is bank-aware, falling back to basic-sequential if it fails.
```

### `-aie-assign-lock-ids`

_Assigns the lockIDs of locks that do not have IDs._

Assigns the lockIDs of locks that do not have IDs.

### `-aie-assign-tile-controller-ids`

_Assign controller id per aie.tile_op_

For each aie.tile_op used in the design, assign a unique controller ID.

#### Options

```
-column-wise-unique-ids : Flag to generate controller ids only unique within each column. Otherwise globally unique.
```

### `-aie-canonicalize-device`

_Canonicalize Designs to include a toplevel device_

This pass inserts a toplevel device operation in designs that do not have one.
This allows us to support backwards compatability for older models targetting the VC1902
device without explicit device operations. 

### `-aie-create-pathfinder-flows`

_Route aie.flow and aie.packetflow operations through switchboxes_

Uses Pathfinder congestion-aware algorithm. 
Each aie.flow is replaced with aie.connect operation.
Each aie.packetflow is replace with the set of aie.amsel, aie.masterset 
and aie.packet_rules operations.

#### Options

```
-route-circuit : Flag to enable aie.flow lowering.
-route-packet  : Flag to enable aie.packetflow lowering.
```

### `-aie-find-flows`

_Recover flows from switchbox configuration_

Under normal circumstances, every configured aie.switchbox operation
should contribute to describing an end-to-end flow from one point
to another.  These flows may be circuit-switched flows (represented
by aie.flow) or a packet-switched connection (represensted by
aie.packetflow).  This pass is primarily used for testing automatic
routing.

### `-aie-generate-column-control-overlay`

_Spawns streaming interconnect network for column control_

For each column of AIE tiles being employed in the design, spawn a network of control packet
streaming interconnects which overlay on top of the design.

#### Options

```
-route-shim-to-tct       : Flag to generate TCT routing between tile CTRL and shim SOUTH ports. Available options: ['shim-only', 'all-tiles', 'disable'].
-route-shim-to-tile-ctrl : Flag to generate routing between shim dma DMA and tile CTRL ports, for configuration.
```

### `-aie-localize-locks`

_Convert global locks to a core-relative index_

An individual lock can be referenced by 4 different AIE cores.  However, each individual core
accesses the lock through a different 'lock address space'.  This pass converts a lock in the
conceptual global address space into a local index.  e.g.:
```
%lock = AIE.lock(%tile, 2)
AIE.core(%tile) {
  AIE.useLock(%lock, "Acquire", 1)
}
```
becomes
```
AIE.core(%tile) {
  %lockindex = arith.constant ? : index
  AIE.useLock(%lockindex, "Acquire", 1)
}
```

### `-aie-lower-cascade-flows`

_Lower aie.cascade_flow operations through `aie.configure_cascade` operations_

Replace each aie.cascade_flow operation with an equivalent set of `aie.configure_cascade` 
operations. 

### `-aie-normalize-address-spaces`

_Remove non-default address spaces_

Early in the flow, it is convenient to represent multiple memories using different
address spaces.  However, after outlining code for AIE engines, the core itself only
has access to a single address space.  To avoid confusion, this pass normalizes
any address spaces remaining in the code, converting them to the default address
space.

### `-aie-objectFifo-stateful-transform`

_Instantiate the buffers and locks of aie.objectFifo.createObjectFifo operations_

Replace each aie.objectFifo.createObjectFifo operation with aie.buffer and aie.lock operations in the 
producer tile. Convert aie.objectFifo.acquire, aie.objectFifo.release and aie.objectFifo.subviewAccess
operations into useLock operations by keeping track of acquire/release operations on each objectFifo by
each process.

If the producer and consumer tiles of an aie.objectFifo.createObjectFifo operation are not adjacent, the 
pass also establised aie.flow and aie.dma operations to enable communication between the tiles.
Extend the body of each loop that contains operations on objectFifos such that it is unrolled
based on the number of elements in the objectFifos. If the number of iterations of the loop 
cannot be divided pefectly by the unrolling factor, the pass duplicates the loop body after 
the original loop.

#### Options

```
-dynamic-objFifos   : Flag to enable dynamic object fifo lowering in cores instead of loop unrolling.
-packet-sw-objFifos : Flag to enable aie.packetflow lowering from objectfifos.
```

### `-aie-register-objectFifos`

_Generate acquire/release patterns for producer/consumer processes registered to an objectFifo_

Generate acquire/release patterns in the CoreOps of associated cores for each 
aie.objectfifo.register_process operation. Patterns are generated as for loops
of different sizes depending on input patterns.

### `-aie-standard-lowering`

_Lowering operations in AIE cores' regions to Standard_

Outline code inside AIE.core operations into the llvm dialect.
BufferOp operations are converted to a GlobalMemrefOp and references to
those buffers are converted to GetGlobalMemrefOp.  Other AIE operations
inside the cores are generally lowered to appropriate function intrinsics.
Other AIE operations (e.g. CoreOp, TileOp, LockOp) outside the core are removed.

Optionally, tileCol and tileRow can specify a single core to export


#### Options

```
-tilecol : X coordinate of tile to generate code for
-tilerow : Y coordinate of tile to generate code for
```

### `-aie-vector-opt`

_Optimize vector instructions for AIE_

After super-vectorization, some additional optimizations are important
for improving QOR and enabling lowering to LLVM.
