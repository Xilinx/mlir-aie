### `-aie-assign-buffer-addresses`: Assign memory locations for buffers in each tile
Buffers in a tile generally have an address that does not significantly
matter in the design.  Hence, most of the time we can instantiate
aie.buffer operations without an address.  This pass determines
updates each aie.buffer operation without an address to have a
well-defined address.  This enables later passes to have a
consistent view of the memory map of a system.
### `-aie-assign-lock-ids`: Assigns the lockIDs of locks that do not have IDs.
Assigns the lockIDs of locks that do not have IDs.
### `-aie-create-packet-flows`: Route aie.packetflow operations through switchboxes
Replace each aie.packetflow operation with an equivalent set of aie.switchbox and aie.wire
operations.  
### `-aie-create-pathfinder-flows`: Route aie.flow operations through switchboxes with Pathfinder algorithm
Replace each aie.flow operation with an equivalent set of aie.switchbox and aie.wire
operations. Uses Pathfinder congestion-aware algorithm. 
### `-aie-find-flows`: Recover flows from switchbox configuration
Under normal circumstances, every configured aie.switchbox operation
should contribute to describing an end-to-end flow from one point
to another.  These flows may be circuit-switched flows (represented
by aie.flow) or a packet-switched connection (represensted by
aie.packetflow).  This pass is primarily used for testing automatic
routing.
### `-aie-localize-locks`: Convert global locks to a core-relative index
An individual lock can be referenced by 4 different AIE cores.  However, each individual core
accesses the lock through a different 'lock address space'.  This pass converts a lock in the
conceptual global address space into a local index.  e.g.:
```
%lock = AIE.lock(%tile, 2)
AIE.core(%tile) {
  AIE.useLock(%lock, "Acquire", 1)
}
```
becomes
```
AIE.core(%tile) {
  %lockindex = arith.constant ? : index
  AIE.useLock(%lockindex, "Acquire", 1)
}
```
### `-aie-normalize-address-spaces`: Remove non-default address spaces
Early in the flow, it is convenient to represent multiple memories using different
address spaces.  However, after outlining code for AIE engines, the core itself only
has access to a single address space.  To avoid confusion, this pass normalizes
any address spaces remaining in the code, converting them to the default address
space.
### `-aie-objectFifo-stateful-transform`: Instantiate the buffers and locks of aie.objectFifo.createObjectFifo operations
Replace each aie.objectFifo.createObjectFifo operation with aie.buffer and aie.lock operations in the 
producer tile. Convert aie.objectFifo.acquire, aie.objectFifo.release and aie.objectFifo.subviewAccess
operations into useLock operations by keeping track of acquire/release operations on each objectFifo by
each process.

If the producer and consumer tiles of an aie.objectFifo.createObjectFifo operation are not adjacent, the 
pass also establised aie.flow and aie.dma operations to enable communication between the tiles.
Extend the body of each loop that contains operations on objectFifos such that it is unrolled
based on the number of elements in the objectFifos. If the number of iterations of the loop 
cannot be divided pefectly by the unrolling factor, the pass duplicates the loop body after 
the original loop.
### `-aie-register-objectFifos`: Generate acquire/release patterns for producer/consumer processes registered to an objectFifo
Generate acquire/release patterns in the CoreOps of associated cores for each 
aie.objectFifo.registerProcess operation. Patterns are generated as for loops
of different sizes depending on input patterns.
### `-aie-standard-lowering`: Lowering operations in AIE cores' regions to Standard
Outline code inside AIE.core operations into the llvm dialect.
BufferOp operations are converted to a GlobalMemrefOp and references to
those buffers are converted to GetGlobalMemrefOp.  Other AIE operations
inside the cores are generally lowered to appropriate function intrinsics.
Other AIE operations (e.g. CoreOp, TileOp, LockOp) outside the core are removed.

Optionally, tileCol and tileRow can specify a single core to export


#### Options
```
-tilecol : X coordinate of tile to generate code for
-tilerow : Y coordinate of tile to generate code for
```
### `-aie-vector-opt`: optimize vector instructions for AIE
After super-vectorization, some additional optimizations are important
for improving QOR and enabling lowering to LLVM.
