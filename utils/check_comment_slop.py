"""Flag comment slop in a diff: repeated explanations, oversized blocks, density.

Runs as a pre-commit hook (staged diff) or in CI (base..head). It reads a diff
rather than whole files, so it never complains about comments a contributor did
not write.

It flags; it never rewrites. Choosing which of several duplicate explanations to
keep needs judgement about where a confused reader lands, and that is not
mechanisable.

Usage:
    python utils/check_comment_slop.py                    # staged diff (pre-commit)
    python utils/check_comment_slop.py --from-ref origin/main --to-ref HEAD
